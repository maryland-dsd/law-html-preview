                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="XX(1)">(1)</span> A trainer may enter up to three horses in an overnight race if that race has a least six entries with separate owners and or trainers.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="XX(2)">(2)</span> If the race is to be divided into two or more races, an entry under the same or separate ownership shall be separated and one horse of the entry shall receive a draw in each division of the original race.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="XX(3)">(3)</span> If possible, the name of the jockey engaged to ride each horse shall be furnished at the time of entry.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="YY(2)">(2)</span> When a horse is stabled at an approved stable area or training center and the trainer works the horse, the trainer shall make a notarized statement to the stewards as to when, where, and the time for the distance the horse worked, and the work shall be announced on the public address system. If it is not the practice of the trainer to work a particular horse he shall make a notarized statement to the stewards as to how the horse is brought up to a race, and this information will be made public by notation on the official program of the racing association or by public address announcement if this information is received after the program is printed.</p>
