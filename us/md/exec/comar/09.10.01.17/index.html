                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="XX(2)">(2)</span> If the race is to be divided into two or more races, an entry under the same or separate ownership shall be separated and one horse of the entry shall receive a draw in each division of the original race.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="XX(3)">(3)</span> If possible, the name of the jockey engaged to ride each horse shall be furnished at the time of entry.
