                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)">(a)</span> For the purposes of this section, a hazardous secondary material is considered to be contained if the material is held in a unit, including a land-based unit, that meets the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The unit is in good condition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The unit has no leaks or other continuing or intermittent releases of hazardous secondary material to the environment, except for releases that are authorized by a permit, such as a permit to discharge to water or air;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> The unit is designed, operated, constructed, and maintained to prevent unpermitted releases to the environment that include, but are not limited to, releases through surface transport by precipitation runoff, releases to soil and ground water, wind-blown dust, fugitive air emissions, and catastrophic unit failures;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(iv)">(iv)</span> The unit is properly labeled or operated with an inventory log or other system to allow the immediate identification of the hazardous secondary material in the unit;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(v)">(v)</span> The unit is operated so that only mutually compatible materials are placed in the unit; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(a)(vi)">(vi)</span> The materials being held in the unit are compatible with the materials of construction of the unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)(b)">(b)</span> A hazardous secondary material is presumptively contained if it is held in a unit that meets the standards in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05" title="Chapter 05 Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities">COMAR 26.13.05</a> or <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.06" title="Chapter 06 Interim Status Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities">26.13.06</a> that would be applicable to the hazardous secondary material if it were regulated as a hazardous waste.</p>
