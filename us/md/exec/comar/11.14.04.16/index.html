The law requires the owner to have, in the vehicle at the time the vehicle is stopped by a police officer, a written certification that details the owner’s medical need for tinted windows, from a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State. A vehicle owner whose vehicle is undergoing an inspection, or has been issued a safety equipment repair order for defect #61 “TINT”, and indicates to the authorized inspection station their compliance with a medical exemption, shall be referred to the Automotive Safety Enforcement Division of the Department of State Police for examination of the vehicle owner’s medical documentation and the vehicle’s post manufacture window tint. If the owner meets the requirements specified in <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gtr&amp;section=22-406" title="">Transportation Article, §22-406, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, for the medical exemption and the vehicle is compliant with all post manufacture window tinting regulations in this chapter, excluding the light transmittance requirement of regulated windows equipped with post manufacture window tint, the Division, when applicable, shall be authorized to:<br/>   (a) Issue a post manufacture window tint medical exemption form to be provided to the authorized inspection station performing an inspection of the vehicle which shall permit the registered inspection mechanic to exempt the vehicle's windows equipped with post manufacture window tint from meeting the light transmittance requirement; or<br/>   (b) Certify the safety equipment repair order for defect #61 “TINT”.</td>
