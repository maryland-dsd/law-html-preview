The first and fourth quarters consist of six vertical bars alternately yellow (representing gold) and black with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed.

The second and third quarters consist of a quartered field of red and white (representing silver) bearing a Greek cross with arms terminating in trefoils. The colors in the second and third quarters alternate, with red being on the white ground and white on the red. The red and white quarters display the arms of Lord Baltimore's maternal family, the Crosslands (Maryland Code, State Government Article, Section 13-202).</p>

                <p>USE OF THE U.S. ENSIGN AND MARYLAND FLAG ON RECREATIONAL BOATS:</p>
                <p>Note: This section does not cover the use of yacht club burgees, owners' private signals, U.S. Power Squadron flags, U.S.C.G. Auxiliary flags, foreign flags, or social and courtesy flags. Rules for these are well-established and may be found in existing literature. The U.S. Ensign with a canton of 50 stars (as the U.S. flag is called while in nautical use) and the U.S. Yacht Ensign, with a canton of 13 stars, are interchangeable on all types of recreational vessels while in national waters. Because the preferred location for the U.S. Power Squadron flag is also the starboard spreader, it may be flown beneath the Maryland flag.</p>
