                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The Secretary shall appoint an advisory council to review all new school applications and make recommendations to the Secretary before a school is given initial approval to operate.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(b)">(b)</span> If the Secretary is satisfied, based on all the information available to the Secretary, that the minimum requirements set forth in these regulations are met, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of approval to operate on the conditions and for a period of time, not to exceed 5 years, as the Secretary may consider appropriate. The Secretary may grant interim approval for the school to operate, specifying the conditions and the duration of the interim approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(c)">(c)</span> The Secretary may accept, as appropriate, the findings of an agency or department of the State that has concurrent approval authority over a school if that agency's standards are substantially similar to these minimum requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(d)">(d)</span> A certificate of approval for each school location shall be issued in the name of the applicant. Certificates of approval are valid for the period specified by the Secretary, unless surrendered by the school or revoked by action of the Secretary. In the event of the death of any individual certificate holder, the certificate may become void. However, the Secretary may grant interim approval for the school to operate, specifying the conditions and the duration of the interim approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> The approval of a school is limited to the location and programs for which application has been made and approval granted.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> If the Secretary has not provided the applicant with either a certificate of approval or a notice of deficiencies within 6 months of the receipt by the Commission of that applicant's completed application, the applicant may request within 20 days a hearing before the Commission to determine if the certificate of approval should be issued. The hearing before the Commission shall be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/Statute_Web/gsg/gsg.pdf" title="">State Government Article, Title 10, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, and COMAR 13B.04.01.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)">(11)</span> A financial statement under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/13B.01.01.04#B(2)(b)" title="">§B(2)(b) of this regulation</a> shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(a)">(a)</span> Be reviewed by a certified public accountant;</p>

The application shall be accompanied by a self-evaluation of the school in a format provided by the Secretary, and by additional information as may be required by the Secretary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> On-Site Visit. A detailed review of the school's programs and operation shall be made by an on-site visit by staff of the Maryland Higher Education Commission or by a team authorized by the Secretary to assess and recommend whether the Commission should renew the authority of the school to operate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> Financial Statement. An application for renewal of approval to operate shall be accompanied by a financial statement reviewed by a certified public accountant which provides a detailed and accurate picture of the financial status of the school.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> A certificate of approval may be issued by the Secretary for a period not to exceed 5 years. If the certificate of approval is issued for less than a 5-year period, the Secretary shall specify what actions or steps the school shall be required to take to attain a certificate of approval for a 5-year period. Failure to meet specified requirements within the time allotted by the Secretary constitutes a violation of these regulations. An approval issued before the effective date of these regulations remains valid for the period set by the Secretary at the time of issuance, provided that no provisions of these regulations are violated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(6)">(6)</span> Financial Requirement. The Secretary shall require a school to forward a financial guarantee described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/13B.01.01.19" title=".19 Financial Guarantee.">Regulation .19 of this chapter</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> The certificate of approval of a school is automatically revoked upon a change of ownership, by whatever means, of that school.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> If an approved school is being sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred, the school and its prospective transferees shall apply for approval for the school before the transfer is consummated. The application shall be made in accordance with regulations governing initial approval.
