                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The Code of Professional Ethics of the AICPA; and</p>

However, in the event of a delinquency proceeding commenced against the insurer under the <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/Statute_Web/gin/gin.pdf" title="">Insurance Article, Title 9, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, the mediation or arbitration provisions shall operate at the option of the statutory successor.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> The lead or coordinating audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit may not act in that capacity for more than 5 consecutive years.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> An insurer may make application to the Commissioner for relief from the rotation requirement in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.05.11.06#D(1)" title="">Â§D(1) of this regulation</a> on the basis of unusual circumstances.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)(a)">(a)</span> Number of partners, expertise of the partners, or the number of insurance clients in the currently registered firm;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> The Commissioner may not recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, or accept an annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by, a natural person who:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Has been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§1961â1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices under federal or state law;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Has been found to have violated the insurance laws of Maryland with respect to any previous reports submitted under this regulation;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> The Commissioner may, as provided in <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=4-118" title="">Insurance Article, Â§4-118, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, hold a hearing to determine whether an independent certified public accountant is qualified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> After considering the evidence presented, the Commissioner may:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)(b)">(b)</span> Require the insurer to replace the accountant with another whose relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of this chapter.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> The actuarially oriented advisory services under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.05.11.06#G(1)(d)" title="">Â§G(1)(d) of this regulation</a> do not include an accountant assisting an insurer in understanding the methods, assumptions, and inputs used in the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statement only if it is reasonable to conclude that the services provided will not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the insurer's financial statements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> The actuarially oriented advisory services under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.05.11.06#G(1)(d)" title="">Â§G(1)(d) of this regulation</a> do not include an accountant's actuary issuing an actuarial opinion or certification opinion on an insurer's reserves if the following conditions are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(a)">(a)</span> Neither the accountant nor the accountant's actuary has performed any management functions or made any management decisions;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(c)">(c)</span> The accountant's actuary tests the reasonableness of the reserves after the insurer's management has determined the amount of the reserves.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> In general, the principles of independence with respect to services provided by the qualified independent certified public accountant are largely predicated on three basic principles, violations of which would impair the accountant's independence. The principles are that accountants cannot function in the role of management, cannot audit their own work, and cannot serve in an advocacy role for the insurer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Exemptions.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> The insurer shall file with the Commissioner a written statement discussing the reasons why the insurer should be exempt from these provisions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(3)">(3)</span> If the Commissioner finds, upon review of this statement, that compliance with this chapter would constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon the insurer, an exemption may be granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> A qualified independent certified public accountant who performs the audit may engage in other non-audit services, including tax services, that are not described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.05.11.06#G(1)" title="">Â§G(1) of this regulation</a> or that do not conflict with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.05.11.06#G(2)" title="">Â§G(2) of this regulation</a>, only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee, in accordance with Â§Â§J and K of this regulation.</p>
