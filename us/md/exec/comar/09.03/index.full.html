A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the value of any collateral pledged. Loans classified as substandard have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the credit union will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected.

A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may strengthen the loan, its classification as an estimated loss may be deferred or limited until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation actions, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.</p>

A loan classified as loss is considered uncollectable and of such little value that its continuance as a loan on the books of a credit union is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may occur in the future.</p>
