                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Within 3 months of identification, the local school system shall revise applicable components of the school system master plan to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(a)">(a)</span> Incorporate scientifically based research strategies that strengthen the core academic program in the schools in the system;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The State Board, upon the recommendation of the State Superintendent of Schools or upon its own motion, shall identify a local school system for corrective action if a local school system does not make the system improvement performance targets in reading, mathematics, or as applicable, attendance rate or graduation rate for 2 consecutive years at each of the elementary school grades (3—5), middle school grades (6—8), and high school grades (9—12) after identification of the school system for system improvement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> Before identifying a local school system for corrective action, the State Board shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> Provide the local school system with an opportunity to review the data on which the proposed identification is based;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> Give the local school system an opportunity to provide supporting evidence if the system believes that the proposed identification is in error for statistically significant reasons; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> Make a final determination of the status of the local school system with respect to identification not later than 30 days after it provides the system with the opportunity to review the data on which the identification is based.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> For a local school system identified for corrective action, the State Board and the State Superintendent of Schools shall continue to make available technical assistance and shall take at least one of the following corrective actions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)">(a)</span> Defer, reduce, or redirect State and federal programmatic and administrative funds including per pupil funding;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)">(f)</span> Through court proceeding, appoint a receiver or trustee to administer the affairs of the local school system in place of the superintendent and school board; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> The State Board may delay implementation of corrective action if a local school system makes the annual measurable objective for which it was identified for corrective action for 1 year or its failure to make the annual measurable objective is due to exceptional circumstances such as acts of nature or an unforeseen decline in financial resources beyond the control of the local school system. A period of delay under this subsection may not be taken into account in determining the number of consecutive years of failure to make AYP.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> If, after 2 years in corrective action, the local school system continues to remain in corrective action, the State Board shall review the actions taken by the local school system and determine if modifications to the corrective action plan are appropriate.</p>

If a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be scheduled promptly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> The hearing shall proceed in the following manner:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(d)">(d)</span> The State Board may ask questions during each presentation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)">(e)</span> Counsel may be present and assist each board, but staff members shall make the presentations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> The State Board shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if the State Superintendent of Schools has provided a sufficient and reasonable basis to support the State Superintendent's recommendation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Transition.</p>
