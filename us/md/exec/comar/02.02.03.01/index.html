                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Scope of Regulation. This regulation prescribes the form and content of the prospectus required to be filed as part of a registration statement for registration of securities by qualification or notification, and to be used in connection with the offering of securities so registered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Registration by Qualification. A prospectus filed as part of a registration statement for registration of securities by qualification shall contain all the information required by Schedule A.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Registration by Notification. A prospectus filed as part of a registration statement for registration of securities by notification shall contain the information required by Schedule A except that the information required by §§F(4), I(2), J, K, L, Q, S(1)(c), and S(2) may be omitted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Legibility of Prospectus. The prospectus may be printed, mimeographed, or typewritten, or prepared by any similar process which will result in clear, legible copies. If printed, it shall be set in clear Roman type at least as large as 10 point modern type, with financial data or other statistical or tabular matter at least as large as 8 point. All type shall be leaded at least 2 points.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Presentation of Information in Prospectus.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> The prospectus shall contain the information called for by all items of Schedule A required to be answered, except that no reference need be made to inapplicable items, and negative answers to any item may be omitted. None of the other information or documents filed as a part of the registration statement need be included in the prospectus.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Unless clearly indicated otherwise, information set forth in any part of the prospectus need not be duplicated elsewhere in the prospectus. When it is deemed necessary or desirable to call attention to the information in more than one part of the prospectus, this may be accomplished by appropriate cross-references. Instead of restating information in the form of notes to the financial statements, references may be made to other parts of the prospectus where the information is set forth.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> The information required in the prospectus need not follow the order of the items in Schedule A. All information contained in the prospectus shall be set forth under appropriate captions or headings reasonably indicative of the principal subject matter set forth under it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> Every prospectus shall include in its forepart a reasonably detailed table of contents showing the subject matter of the various sections or subdivisions and the page number on which each section or subdivision begins.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Date of Prospectus.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Each prospectus used after the effective date of the registration statement shall be dated approximately as of the effective date, provided, however, that a revised or amended prospectus used after it need only bear the approximate date of its issuance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> Each supplement to a prospectus shall be separately dated with the approximate date of its issuance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Exchange Offers. If any of the securities being registered are to be offered in exchange for securities of any other issuer, the prospectus shall also include the information which would be required by §§F—O of Schedule A if the securities of an issuer were being registered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Preliminary Prospectus. A prospectus filed as part of a registration statement is a preliminary prospectus until the registration statement has become effective. Every preliminary prospectus shall bear on the outside front cover page the following caption underscored or in red ink, "Preliminary Prospectus", and the following statement, in type as large as that generally in the body of the prospectus:</p>
                <p>"A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Division of Securities of the Department of Law of Maryland, but has not yet become effective. Information contained herein is subject to completion or amendment. These securities may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Required Legend. Every prospectus shall bear the following legend in capital letters on the outside front cover page:</p>
                <p class="quote ">"THESE SECURITIES ARE OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION WITH THE DIVISION OF SECURITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW OF MARYLAND, BUT REGISTRATION IS PERMISSIVE ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A FINDING THAT THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUE, COMPLETE, AND NOT MISLEADING, NOR HAS THE DIVISION OF SECURITIES PASSED IN ANY WAY UPON THE MERITS OF, RECOMMENDED, OR GIVEN APPROVAL TO THESE SECURITIES. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> Use of Prospectus.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)">(1)</span> It is a condition of registration of securities by qualification or notification that a prospectus satisfying the requirements of this regulation shall be sent or given to each person to whom an offer is made as required by §11-502(c) or 11-504(d) of the Maryland Securities Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(2)">(2)</span> When a prospectus is used more than 9 months after the effective date of the registration statement, the information contained in it shall be as of a date not more than 16 months before the use, so far as the information is known to the user of the prospectus or can be furnished by the user without unreasonable effort or expense.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(3)">(3)</span> In addition to the requirements of §J(2), if a prospectus becomes misleading or inaccurate in any material respect, its use shall be discontinued, and it shall be revised or supplemented in such a way that it may not be misleading or inaccurate in any material respect. Three copies of a revised or supplemented prospectus shall be promptly filed with the Commissioner. Nothing in this paragraph shall be taken to relieve any person from the requirements of §11-502(c) or 11-504(d) of the Maryland Securities Act.</p>
