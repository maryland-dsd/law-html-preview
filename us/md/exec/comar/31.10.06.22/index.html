                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> Section 1882(d) of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ss) prohibits the sale of a health insurance policy (the term policy includes certificate) to Medicare beneficiaries that duplicates Medicare benefits unless it will pay benefits without regard to a beneficiary's other health coverage and it includes the prescribed disclosure statement on or together with the application for the policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> All types of health insurance policies that duplicate Medicare shall include one of the attached disclosure statements, according to the particular policy type involved, on the application or together with the application. The disclosure statement may not vary from the attached statements in terms of language or format (type size, type proportional spacing, bold character, line spacing, and usage of boxes around text).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> State and federal law prohibits insurers from selling a Medicare supplement policy to a person that already has a Medicare supplement policy except as a replacement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Property/casualty and life insurance policies are not considered health insurance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> Disability income policies are not considered to provide benefits that duplicate Medicare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> Long-term care insurance policies that coordinate with Medicare and other health insurance are not considered to provide benefits that duplicate Medicare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> The federal law does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the federal requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> The federal law does not preempt existing state form filing requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)">(9)</span> Section 1882 of the federal Social Security Act was amended in subsection (d)(3)(A) to allow for alternative disclosure statements. The disclosure statements already in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.22#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a> remain. Carriers may use either disclosure statement with the requisite insurance product.
