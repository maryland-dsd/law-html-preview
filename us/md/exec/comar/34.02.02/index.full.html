                <p>Proper management and use of State resources requires a continuing and critical review of the real property held by the State to assure that it is being properly utilized. All State agencies are encouraged to initiate and conduct on a continuing basis a survey of all real property under their control and jurisdiction to identify those properties which are not utilized, are under-utilized, or are not being put to optimum use and are not required to meet future needs. These regulations are intended to provide guidance to State agencies for the reporting of excess and substantial changes in State- owned real property and requests for the granting of rights-of-way or easements and to establish the coordination procedures associated with the reports submitted. This program will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the acquisition of real property when State agency needs can be met by utilizing real property currently owned by the State, and insure that maximum benefits to the State are realized by the utilization or disposal of this property for the most appropriate use which is compatible with the plans and programs of State and local agencies. Further, it will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the operation, care, and maintenance of property not needed to meet current or projected requirements.</p>
