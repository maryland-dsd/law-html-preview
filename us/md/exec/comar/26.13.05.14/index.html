                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Applicability. This regulation applies to owners and operators of facilities that dispose of hazardous waste in landfills, except as <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.01" title=".01 General.">Regulation .01 of this chapter</a> provides otherwise.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Any landfill not covered by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.14#B(3)" title="">§B(3) of this regulation</a> or <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.06.22#C" title="">COMAR 26.13.06.22C</a> shall have a liner system for all portions of the landfill, except for existing portions of the landfill. The liner system shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> Have a liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the landfill to the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the active life, including the closure period, of the landfill. The liner shall be constructed of materials that prevent wastes from passing into the liner during the active life of the facility. The liner shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, including static head external hydrogeologic forces, physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(iv)">(iv)</span> Located entirely above natural seasonal high water table. Minimal distance will be specified by the Secretary in the permit.</p>

The Secretary will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (1 foot). The leachate collection and removal system shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used at the landfill; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the landfill.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(c)(iii)">(iii)</span> Thickness and classification of in-situ soils; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(c)(iv)">(iv)</span> Water table surface or potentiometric surface of each aquifer within 50 feet of the facility boundaries.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.14#B(1)" title="">§B(1) of this regulation</a> if the Secretary finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternative design and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see Regulation .06-1B of this chapter) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Secretary shall consider:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> A composite bottom liner, consisting of at least two components, that satisfies the requirements of §B(3)(c) and (d) of this regulation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(c)">(c)</span> The upper component of a composite bottom liner shall be designed and constructed to prevent the migration of any constituent into the upper component during the active life of the landfill and the post-closure care period;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)">(d)</span> The lower component of a composite bottom liner shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)(i)">(i)</span> Designed and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> Constructed of at least a 3-foot thick layer of recompacted clay or other natural material with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 x 10-7 centimeter per second;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(i)">(i)</span> To collect and remove leachate from the landfill during the active life and post-closure care period;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(ii)">(ii)</span> In accordance with conditions specified by the Department in the facility permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 centimeters (1 foot); and</p>
