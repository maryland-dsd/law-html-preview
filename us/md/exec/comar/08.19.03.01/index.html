                <p>The following Model Ordinance shall be to assist and guide in the development of a local program. This Model Ordinance will further enable each unit of local government with planning and zoning authority to determine the size, location and orientation of forest to be retained, and prioritize tracts of land for reforestation and afforestation. Although it is the intention of the Department that this chapter be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose, a local authority shall demonstrate that the substantive provisions of each article are incorporated in the local program. Some local authorities may be able to adopt this Ordinance with only minor changes appropriate to each jurisdiction. Other local authorities may choose to use elements of this Ordinance to amend existing laws, statutes, or Ordinances.</p>
