                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Any trustee who does not file the statement on the date it is due is liable for a civil penalty or fine of $250 per day for each day the filing of the statement is delayed, unless an extension is granted and a stay of filing is granted as provided in §§E, F, and G of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> This penalty or fine may not be considered reasonable costs for purposes of rate setting by the Commission if the hospital or related institution reimburses or indemnifies the trustee therefor in any manner.</p>

The penalty may be modified in accordance with the Commission's decision, and the Commission may abate or reduce the penalty as justice and equity may require.</p>
