                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Any trustee who does not file the statement on the date it is due is liable for a civil penalty or fine of $250 per day for each day the filing of the statement is delayed, unless an extension is granted and a stay of filing is granted as provided in §§E, F, and G of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> This penalty or fine may not be considered reasonable costs for purposes of rate setting by the Commission if the hospital or related institution reimburses or indemnifies the trustee therefor in any manner.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Any trustee denied or given an inadequate extension of time under §E, of this regulation, may file a written petition with the Commission to review the action of the Executive Director in refusing his request for extension or giving him an inadequate extension, within 10 days of the date on which the trustee was notified in writing of the action with respect to the requested extension. The petition shall state the grounds for the proposed extension and request a review of the denial of his request for it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> A hearing on the petition, at which the petitioner may be represented by counsel, shall be held within 20 days of the date on which the petition was filed, before a disclosure subcommittee composed of one or more members of the Commission chosen by the Chairman for that purpose.</p>

The filing of a petition pursuant to §F, of this regulation, may not stay the accrual of the penalty imposed pursuant to §D, of this regulation. However, the penalty may not be assessed against or collected from the trustee until the conclusion of the proceeding initiated by the trustee's petition. The penalty may be modified in accordance with the Commission's decision, and the Commission may abate or reduce the penalty as justice and equity may require.</p>
