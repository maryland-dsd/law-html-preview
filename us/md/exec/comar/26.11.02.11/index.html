                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> Before issuing a permit to construct for any of the activities listed in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.02.11#A(2)" title="">§A(2) of this regulation</a>, at a source that is subject to federal new source performance standards under 40 CFR 60, the Department shall either comply with the provisions of §§E—N of this regulation, or with the following procedures:</p>

These procedures may provide for combined public notices, informational meetings, and public hearings for both permits but may not adversely affect the rights of a person, including the EPA and affected states, to obtain information about the application for a permit, to comment on an application, or to challenge a permit that is issued. In addition, these procedures may not alter any existing Part 70 permit procedures or time frames.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Application. The owner or operator of a source subject to this regulation shall submit a complete application on forms provided by the Department.
