                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Before the first heat or race at any meeting is contested, the officials and drivers shall meet at a time and place designated by the presiding judge, at which time the rules and regulations shall be discussed and all drivers' licenses shall be examined by the starter. Every driver shall be notified of the time and place of the meeting. A driver who shall, after notice, fail to attend the meeting may not be permitted to drive until he shall have met with the officials of the meeting by appointment thereafter at their convenience, and may be fined in a sum not to exceed $100.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> All horses shall race from the paddock and shall be in the paddock 60 minutes before off-time of the first heat or race in which they are scheduled to start, and, if racing more than one heat or race, shall return to the paddock after each heat or race until the final heat or race in which the horses are scheduled to start has been completed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> The judges shall ring a bell or otherwise notify the paddock 15 minutes before the off-time announced for the heat or race, which shall be notice to all parties to prepare for the heat or race. All horses shall parade from the paddock upon the track and before the grandstand not later than 8 minutes before off-time. A horse or driver not on the track 8 minutes before off-time ready to parade shall be fined not exceeding $100 and his horse may be ruled out by the judges and considered withdrawn at their discretion. In all stakes and matches, failure to appear constitutes a forfeit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> At the conclusion of each heat or race, every driver shall return in the sulky to be dismissed by the patrol judge stationed at the wire. A driver may not dismount or leave the track until permission to do so has been granted by the patrol judge. A driver desiring to enter a claim of foul or other complaint of violation of the rules shall, before dismounting, indicate to the patrol judge his desire to enter the claim or complaint and forthwith shall proceed to the paddock and telephone the judges' stand, where and when the claim of foul or other complaint of violation of the rules shall be immediately entered. A complaint may not be considered unless made to the judges in the manner provided in these regulations. The judges may not cause the official sign to be displayed until the claim of foul or other complaint of violation of the rules has been entered and considered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> In the event of an accident occurring in the course of a heat or race, the cause shall be investigated by the judges immediately at the conclusion of the heat or race. A driver or drivers may be called to the telephone for the purpose of the investigation. The judges may not cause the official sign to be displayed until an investigation is made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> All heats or races shall be started from a starting gate or starting device or a design approved by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> If racing pursuant to license is conducted at night, the post time for the first race shall be set by the association conducting the meeting, the time to be approved by the Commission. If, due to inclement weather, track conditions, power failure, or any other cause, the post time of the first race must be delayed, the post time of the first race may not be later than 8:45 p.m. The post time of the last heat or race may not be later than 11:59 p.m., unless permission is granted by the Maryland Racing Commission.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(10)(d)">(d)</span> The judges may set any horse back one or more places if, in their judgment, any of the above violations have been committed.</p>
