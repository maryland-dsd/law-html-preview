                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Chapter Four. Chapter four shall contain a description of the existing and planned community and multi-use sewerage systems, including tables, maps, charts, graphs, descriptive information and all other matters regarding these systems. Indicate locations of proposed points of waste discharges. It shall be shown how conformance of existing and programmed sewerage facilities meet or will meet the effluent limitations specified in COMAR 26.08.03.01 of the Department of the Environment. It shall contain a summary of each available point of discharge evaluation, specifically those parts pertaining to protected water uses. It shall discuss the rationale for selecting a planned alternative for any proposed treatment facility, pumping station, or interceptor. For every service area and community system, the following should be discussed: operating agency, design average and peak flows; whether combined or separate collection systems; level and type of treatment given; sludge disposal plans, condition of treatment and transmission facilities; operation and maintenance costs; and proposed means of financing improvements. Minimum requirements for tables and maps in this chapter shall be as follows:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> The following physical format shall be required for the submission of county plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(a)">(a)</span> Textual materials, tables, charts, graphs, and other illustrations shall be prepared on 8-1/2 Ã 11-inch stock or any other size which can be folded for inclusion in the binder. Margins on the left-hand edge shall be punched for a multi-ringed 10 Ã 11-1/2-inch interchangeable stiff-backed binder with identification on the binder.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(b)">(b)</span> The Maryland Coordinate Grid System shall be used to determine place locations. The Maryland State Highway System maps use this system with lines spaced at intervals of 50,000 feet bearing due east and due north from the points of origin. Other maps can be used by superimposing a similar grid on any map of Maryland. Referenced to the same point of origin, it then becomes possible to find any place on the map if its coordinates are known. Two numbers define any place location on the map. The first number designates the distance in thousands of feet that the place lies east of the point of origin, and the second number, the distance in thousands of feet that the place lies north of the point of origin.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(c)">(c)</span> All projections shall be made for decade years except that for the first decade. The mid-period shall also be shown (e.g. 1970, 1975, 1980, 1990, 2000).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(d)">(d)</span> Two maps of the entire county to a scale of approximately 1 inch equal to 1 mile shall be included showing, in general, areas served or to be served with community facilities. One map shall be for sewerage facilities and the other water supply facilities. These maps shall be folded, inserted into separate pockets marked "water" and "sewerage" and placed into the multiple-ringed stiff-backed binder.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(e)">(e)</span> Two sets of detailed maps (one for water facilities and the other for sewerage facilities) of each portion of the county shall be prepared on a minimum scale of 1 inch equal to 2,000 feet and in sufficient number so to show actual areas served or to be served as set forth in these regulations. A minimum scale of "1 inch equals 3500 feet" is acceptable in those counties where existing detail mapping is complete or is under preparation. For those counties where detail maps have not been initiated, a scale of "1 inch equals 2000 feet" shall be the minimum requirement. Color coding on the maps is optional.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(f)">(f)</span> Amendments or revisions to the county plan shall be prepared so that the new or additional material may be inserted in the binder in the appropriate places to provide a continuously updated and current county comprehensive water and sewerage plan. Each sheet of the amendment or revision shall be dated to show when the change became effective.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(g)">(g)</span> Measurements as specified in this regulation shall be converted to their metric equivalence when applicable.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(a)">(a)</span> Delineate on the maps, existing or proposed and planned community and multi-use water and sewerage facilities, including wells, reservoirs, intakes, transmission and feeder mains, storage facilities, interceptor and truck sewers, pumping stations, force mains, treatment works, outfall sewers, and service areas. Show on the detailed maps sizes or capacities, or both, where appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(b)">(b)</span> Delineate on the maps areas served by community and multi-use water and sewerage systems which are either existing or are under construction. The actual bounds of areas served by these systems shall be clearly indicated. The areas so delineated in this category shall be as shown in Table 14 and shall be referred to as W-1 for water systems and S-1 for sewerage systems.</p>

The areas so shown in this category shall be as shown in Table 14 and shall be referred to as W-3 for water systems and S-3 for sewerage systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(e)">(e)</span> Delineate on the maps areas where improvements to, or construction of, new community and multi-use water supply and sewerage systems will be programmed for the 3 to 5/6 year period. The areas so shown in this category shall be as shown in Table 14 and shall be referred to as W-4 for water systems and S-4 for sewerage systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(f)">(f)</span> Delineate on the maps those areas where improvements to, or construction of, new community and multi-use water supply and sewerage systems are programmed for inclusion within the 6/7 through 10-year period. The areas so shown in this category shall be as shown in Table 14 and shall be referred to as W-5 for water systems and S-5 for sewerage systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(g)">(g)</span> All other areas of the county should be shown as no planned service. The areas so shown in this category shall be as shown in Table 14 and shall be referred to as W-6 for water systems and S-6 for sewerage systems.</p>
