                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> After inquiry by the Department, for a greater period, if the recipient of services, the responsible relatives of the recipient, or any other person, agency, or organization having a summary of financial information or medical or psychological diagnoses about the recipient of services has failed or refused to give that information to the Department when the obtaining and use of this information is connected to the Department's billing and collection functions under this subtitle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> The Department shall make a claim against all available income or assets, or both, of a recipient of services.</p>

In recognition of an individual's ongoing financial needs, the Department shall consider a reduction in a recipient of services' billing by permitting the income allowances, asset exemptions, and allowable expenses indicated below. A billing reduction may not be permitted unless and until the recipient of services submits appropriate written documentation demonstrating his or her entitlement to the billing reduction. Permitted billing reductions are as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> Exempted Assets. The following assets shall be excluded from the Department's ability to pay determinations:</p>

The assessed value of a recipient of services' primary residence may not be considered for the purpose of establishing charges incurred by the recipient of services during the first 6 months of the individual's hospitalization. An additional 6 months exemption may be allowed if the recipient of services provides written verification from the Department clinician who is primarily responsible for the individual's care which indicates that there is a reasonable clinical likelihood that the individual will be discharged from the facility not later than 12 months following his or her admission to the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(c)">(c)</span> Household furnishings.</p>
