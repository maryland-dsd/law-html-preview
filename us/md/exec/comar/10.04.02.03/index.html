In recognition of an individual's ongoing financial needs, the Department shall consider a reduction in a recipient of services' billing by permitting the income allowances, asset exemptions, and allowable expenses indicated below. A billing reduction may not be permitted unless and until the recipient of services submits appropriate written documentation demonstrating his or her entitlement to the billing reduction. Permitted billing reductions are as follows:</p>
