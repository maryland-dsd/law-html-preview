                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> "Chelate" means the type of compound or chemical union in which a central metal (cation or anion) is joined to a chelating agent in the same molecule by two or more bonds. These linkages result in the formation of one or more heterocyclic rings in which the metal is part of the ring.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> "Chelated plant nutrients" means compounds of metallic secondary and micro plant nutrients with organic chelating agents which have the property of being available under pH conditions in which the nutrients normally form insoluble compounds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> "Chelating agent (sequestering agent)" means a compound having two or more sites of attachment to a metal (cation or anion) to form a chelate. Examples are EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid), polyphosphoric acid, proteins and polyflavanoids.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> "Coated slow release fertilizer" means a fertilizer containing sources of water soluble nutrients, whose release is controlled by a coating applied to the fertilizer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> "Filler" means a substance added to fertilizer materials to provide bulk, prevent caking, or serve some purpose other than providing essential plant nutrients.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> "Granular fertilizer" means a fertilizer in which 95 percent or more of the product is retained on a series of sieves within the range of 8 mesh (2.38 mm. opening) to 20 mesh (0.841 mm. opening), and in which the largest particle passes through a sieve having an opening not larger than four times that of the sieve which would retain 95 percent or more of the product.</p>
