                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The Double Triple is a form of pari-mutuel wagering in which the bettor selects the three horses that will finish first, second, and third in each of the two designated races of the Double Triple, in the exact order of finish as officially posted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> The two races which comprise the Double Triple shall be approved by the Commission and clearly designated in the program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Each bettor purchasing a Double Triple ticket shall designate his three selections as the first three horses to finish in that order in the first race of the designated two races of the Double Triple.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> After wagering closes for the first race of the designated two races of the Double Triple, all applicable commissions and taxes shall be deducted from the pool in accordance with the laws of the State. The remaining net pool shall then be divided into two separate pools of equal amounts. The following apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> The first part of the divided pool shall be distributed among the holders of Double Triple tickets selecting the first three horses, in exact order of finish, on the designated first race of the Double Triple, in accordance with established pari-mutuel practice. The first part of the divided pool shall consist of 1/2 of the net distributable pool of the total monies wagered on the first race of the Double Triple on the current day's program only. Specifically excluded from this shall be any carry-over of any Double Triple pool from any previous day's program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> The second part of the divided pool shall be placed in a separate pool to be distributed among holders of Second Half Double Triple tickets selecting the first three horses, in exact order, on the designated second race of the Double Triple, in accordance with the established pari-mutuel practice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> In the first race of the Double Triple only, if there is a failure to select the first three horses, in exact order of finish, payoffs shall be made on Double Triple tickets selecting, in the following order of priority, which are the first two horses in exact order, but if there is no ticket outstanding, then the first horse. Failure of any ticket to select the first horse to win, regardless of the selection of the exact order of the second or third horse, or both, shall cause a refund of all Double Triple tickets issued on that race. If there is no winning ticket selecting the first three horses in exact order of finish, then any ticket within the applicable order of priority as previously stated is considered a winning ticket for distribution of the first race pool only, but does not entitle the holder of it to an exchange ticket.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> After the official declaration of the first three horses to finish in the first race of the Double Triple, each bettor holding a winning ticket shall, before the running of the second designated race of the Double Triple, exchange at the designated Double Triple windows the winning ticket for both the monetary value from the first part of divided pool, as established by the mutuels department of the Association, and a Double Triple exchange ticket which designates the bettor's selection of the three horses for finish in that order in the second designated race of the Double Triple. Further money may not be required of the holder of the winning ticket in order to make the exchange. Until the second race of the Double Triple has been declared official, a person may not disclose the number of winning Double Triple tickets eligible for exchange in the second Double Triple race, nor shall any person disclose any information regarding those tickets during the exchange process.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> A Double Triple exchange ticket for the second race of the Double Triple may not be issued except upon surrender of the Double Triple ticket from the first race as described in these rules. Windows, for the purpose of cashing and exchanging of winning Double Triple tickets, shall be open for the purpose of making exchange as described above only after the first race of the Double Triple has been declared official. The windows shall close when wagering closes for the second race of the Double Triple.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> If a winning Double Triple ticket from the first race is not presented for cashing and exchange within the time provided above, the bettor may still collect the monetary value attached to the ticket but shall forfeit all rights to any distribution resulting from the second race of the Double Triple.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> If a dead heat or heats occur in either the first race or second race of the Double Triple, all Double Triple tickets selecting the correct order of finish counting a horse in a dead heat as finishing in any position dead heated shall be winning tickets, and, contrary to the usual practice, the aggregate winning tickets shall be divided into the net pool and be paid the same pay-off price.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> If there is no Double Triple ticket issued accurately selecting the officially declared first three finishers of the second race of the Double Triple, in the exact order, the second race pool, determined as provided in this rule, shall be held for the next consecutive racing day and combined with the pool of that program's second race of the Double Triple. Distribution of this special cumulative pool of the second race of the Double Triple shall be made only upon the accurate selection, in the exact order, of the first three officially declared finishers of the second race of the Double Triple.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)">(2)</span> If a horse is scratched in the second race of the Double Triple, the stewards shall act as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(a)">(a)</span> If there are more than 5 minutes to post remaining, as displayed on the infield tote board, the stewards shall declare, by means of a public address announcement, that tickets which include the scratched horse shall be exchanged before the running of the race; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(b)">(b)</span> If there are 5 minutes or less to post remaining, as displayed on the infield tote board, the stewards shall determine if there are tickets issued which contain the scratched horse and act as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(b)(i)">(i)</span> If there are no tickets, the Second Half Double Triple betting is not affected; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> If there are tickets, the stewards shall declare, by means of a public address announcement, that the Second Half Double Triple wager for that day is cancelled, that the entire second part of the divided pool resulting from that current day's program only shall be distributed among all holders of Second Half Double Triple tickets, in accordance with established pari-mutuel practice, and that any carry-over of any Double Triple pool from any previous day's program may not be distributed on that racing day and shall be carried over to the next consecutive racing day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> If for any reason the field for either the first race or the second race of the Double Triple is reduced to less than seven interests before wagering is opened for the first race of the Double Triple, then Double Triple wagering may not be conducted on that day. If wagering has opened for the Double Triple and the field for either the first race or the second race of the Double Triple is reduced to less than seven interests before the first race of the Double Triple has been run, the stewards shall determine, in their sole and final discretion, whether Double Triple wagering will be refunded and not conducted on that day. If after the first race of the Double Triple has been run the field in the second race of the Double Triple is reduced to less than seven interests, the stewards shall determine, in their sole and final discretion, whether the race will be run as the second race of the Double Triple or, alternatively, whether Double Triple wagering will be cancelled, in which event the entire second part of the divided pool resulting from that current day's program only shall be distributed among all holders of Second Half Double Triple tickets, in accordance with established pari-mutuel practice, and any carry-over of any Double Triple pool from any previous day's program may not be distributed on that racing day and shall be carried over to the next consecutive racing day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> If for any reason the second race of the Double Triple is not declared official, the winning ticket holders who have cashed their ticket of the first race of the Double Triple and have received an exchange ticket, shall be entitled to be paid the remaining amount of the current program's divided pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Sales of Double Triple tickets other than from pari-mutuel machines shall be deemed illegal and prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O">O.</span> The Double Triple pool shall be held entirely separate from all other pools, and may not be part of a daily double, exacta, triple, pick six, or other wagering pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="P">P.</span> If the accumulated carry-over pool of the Double Triple has not been distributed before the closing day of the meeting in which the pool was generated, the accumulated pool shall be carried over to the thoroughbred association next to operate that accepts Double Triple wagering. If the association next to operate does not accept Double Triple wagering, the accumulated pool shall be deposited in a Maryland bank in interest-bearing form and the accumulated pool together with all interest earned on it shall be carried over to the first day of the next racing meet of the thoroughbred association accepting Double Triple wagering.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Q">Q.</span> Coupled entries are permitted but fields are prohibited in Double Triple races.</p>

Each purchaser of a Double Triple ticket shall agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this and all other applicable Commission rules and regulations and by the laws of the State pertaining to pari-mutuel wagering. The Association, totalisator company, and the State may not be liable to any person for a Double Triple ticket which is not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="R(1)">(1)</span> A winning ticket in accordance with the provisions of this rule; or</p>
