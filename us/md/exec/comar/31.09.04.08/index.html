An insurer which has established a separate investment account as defined in <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=5-512" title="">Insurance Article, §5-512, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, may, upon express approval by the Commissioner, use the same segregated asset account as both a separate investment account and a variable contract account.</p>

An insurer may not hypothecate any of the assets of any variable contract account or borrow on the security of these assets. An investment, other than cash, in any variable contract account, in any separate account, or in the insurer's general investment account may not be transferred by sale, exchange, substitution, or otherwise from one account to another except with the Commissioner's approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Assets allocated to a variable contract account shall be owned by the insurer and the insurer may not be, or hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to these assets.</p>

This statement shall be in such form and content as is approved or adopted for current use by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or its successor organization and as supplemented for additional information required by the Commissioner and shall include details as to all of the income, disbursements, assets, and liability items associated with the variable contract accounts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> The valuation of variable contract account assets for all purposes, including annual statements of the insurer to the Commissioner, shall be determined in accordance with the market value of the assets notwithstanding the application of other valuation methods to assets of the insurer other than the assets of the variable contract accounts. The valuation may be made as of such valuation dates as the insurer shall establish from time to time, except as otherwise required for the annual statements to the Commissioner. To accomplish the valuation at market value any equity security purchased for variable contract account shall be a security:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Which is listed or admitted to trading on a securities exchange located in the United States of America or Canada; or</p>
