                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Filing for Approval to Do Business in This State. Before an insurer shall deliver or issue for delivery a variable life insurance policy in this State, it shall file with the Commissioner the following information for the consideration of the Commissioner in making the determination required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.02.03#B" title="">Â§B of this regulation</a>:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Copies of and a general description of the variable life insurance policies it intends to issue.</p>

The statement of investment policy shall include a description of the investment objective and orientation intended for the separate account.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> A description of any investment advisory services contemplated as required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.02.06#J" title="">Regulation .06J of this chapter</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Standards of Suitability. An insurer seeking approval to enter into the variable life insurance business in this State shall adopt by formal action of its board of directors and file with the Commissioner a written statement specifying the standards of suitability to be used by the insurer and applicable to its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents with respect to the suitability of variable life insurance for the applicant. These standards of suitability shall be binding on the insurer and those to whom it refers, and shall specify that no recommendations shall be made to an applicant to purchase a variable life insurance policy and that no variable life insurance policy may be issued in the absence of reasonable grounds to believe that the purchase of the policy is suitable for the applicant on the basis of information furnished after reasonable inquiry of the applicant concerning the applicant's insurance and investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and any other information known to the insurer or to the agent making the recommendation. Lapse rates for variable life insurance within the first 2 policy years which are significantly higher than both those encountered by the insurer, or an affiliate of the insurer, for corresponding fixed benefit life insurance policies and lapse rates of other insurers issuing variable life insurance policies shall be considered by the Commissioner in determining whether the guidelines adopted by the insurer are reasonable and also whether the insurer and its agents are engaging, as a general business practice, in the sale of variable life insurance to persons for whom it is unsuitable. For purposes of this section, conversions from variable life insurance to fixed benefit life insurance policies pursuant to this chapter will not be considered lapses.</p>
