                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> An issuer shall collect and file with the Commissioner by May 31 of each year the data contained in the reporting form in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.19" title=".19 Report Form for Calculation of Loss Ratios.">Regulation .19 of this chapter</a> for each type of standard Medicare supplement benefit plan.</p>

The refund calculation shall be done on a Statewide basis for each type in a standard Medicare supplement benefit plan. For purposes of the refund or credit calculation, experience on policies issued within the reporting year shall be excluded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> For purposes of this section, for policies or certificates issued before July 1, 1992, the issuer shall make the refund or credit calculation separately for all individual policies, including all group policies subject to an individual loss ratio standard when issued, combined and all other group policies combined for experience after April 1, 1996. The first report shall be due by May 31, 1998.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> A refund or credit shall be made only when the benchmark loss ratio exceeds the adjusted experience loss ratio and the amount to be refunded or credited exceeds a de minimis level. The refund shall include interest from the end of the calendar year to the date of the refund or credit at a rate specified by the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services, but may not be less than the average rate of interest for 13-week Treasury notes. A refund or credit against premiums due shall be made by September 30 following the experience year upon which the refund or credit is based.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> An issuer of Medicare supplement policies and certificates issued before or after the effective date of these regulations in this State shall file annually its rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation including ratios of incurred losses to earned premiums by policy duration for approval by the Commissioner in accordance with the filing requirements and procedures required by the Commissioner. The supporting documentation shall also demonstrate in accordance with actuarial standards of practice, using reasonable assumptions, that the appropriate loss ratio standards can be expected to be met over the entire period for which rates are computed. The demonstration shall exclude active life reserves. An expected third year loss ratio which is greater than or equal to the applicable percentage shall be demonstrated for policies or certificates in force less than 3 years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> As soon as practicable, but before the effective date of enhancements in Medicare benefits, every issuer of Medicare supplement policies or certificates in this State shall file with the Commissioner in accordance with the applicable filing procedures of this State:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(a)">(a)</span> Appropriate premium adjustments necessary to produce loss ratios as anticipated for the current premium for the applicable policies or certificates; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)">(b)</span> Supporting documents as necessary to justify the adjustment which shall accompany the filing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> An issuer shall make the premium adjustments which are necessary to produce an expected loss ratio under the policy or certificate to conform with minimum loss ratio standards for Medicare supplement policies in compliance with §A(1)(a) and (b) of this regulation and which are expected to result in a loss ratio at least as great as that originally anticipated in the rates used to produce current premiums by the issuer for the Medicare supplement policies or certificates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> A premium adjustment which would modify the loss ratio experience under the policy other than the adjustments described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.11#C(3)" title="">§C(3) of this regulation</a> may not be made with respect to a policy at any time other than upon its renewal date or anniversary date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> If an issuer fails to make premium adjustments acceptable to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may order premium adjustments, refunds, or premium credits considered necessary to achieve the loss ratio required by this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(6)">(6)</span> Before the effective date of changes in Medicare benefits, every issuer of Medicare supplement policies or certificates in this State shall file with the Commissioner for approval appropriate riders, endorsements, or policy forms needed to accomplish the Medicare supplement policy or certificate modifications necessary to eliminate benefit duplications with Medicare. The riders, endorsements, or policy forms shall provide a clear description of the Medicare supplement benefits provided by the policy or certificate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Public Hearings. The Commissioner may conduct a public hearing to gather information concerning a request by an issuer for an increase in a rate for a policy form or certificate form issued before or after the effective date of these regulations if the experience of the form for the previous reporting period is not in compliance with the applicable loss ratio standard. The determination of compliance is made without consideration of any refund or credit for the reporting period. Public notice of the hearing shall be furnished in a manner considered appropriate by the Commissioner.</p>
