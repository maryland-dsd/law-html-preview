                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> The Commission shall have the exclusive power of parole release. In determining whether a prisoner is suitable for release on parole, the Commission considers:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)(a)">(a)</span> The circumstances surrounding the crime;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)(b)">(b)</span> The physical, mental, and moral qualifications of persons who become eligible for parole;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)(c)">(c)</span> Whether there is reasonable probability that the prisoner, if released on parole, will remain at liberty without violating the laws; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)(d)">(d)</span> Whether the release of the prisoner on parole is compatible with the welfare of society.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> The Commission also considers the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)(a)">(a)</span> Whether there is substantial risk the individual will not conform to the conditions of parole;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)(b)">(b)</span> Whether release at the time would depreciate the seriousness of the individual's crime or promote disrespect for the law;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)(c)">(c)</span> Whether the individual's release would have an adverse affect on institutional discipline;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)(d)">(d)</span> Whether the individual's continued incarceration will substantially enhance his ability to lead a law abiding life when released at a later date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> When deciding if an inmate serving a life sentence for a crime committed while younger than 18 years old is suitable for parole, the Commission shall consider whether the inmate has adequately demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation since commission of the crime.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> In addition to the factors contained in Â§A(1)â(3) of this regulation, the Commission shall consider the following mitigating factors, to which it affords appropriate weight, in determining whether an inmate who committed a crime as a juvenile is suitable for release on parole:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(a)">(a)</span> Age at the time the crime was committed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(b)">(b)</span> The individualâs level of maturity and sense of responsibility at the time of the crime was committed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(c)">(c)</span> Whether influence or pressure from other individuals contributed to the commission of the crime;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(d)">(d)</span> Whether the prisonerâs character developed since the time of the crime in a manner that indicates the prisoner will comply with the conditions of release;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(e)">(e)</span> The home environment and family relationships at the time the crime was committed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(f)">(f)</span> The individualâs educational background and achievement at the time the crime was committed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(g)">(g)</span> Other factors or circumstances unique to prisoners who committed crimes at the time the individual was a juvenile that the Commissioner determines to be relevant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> To make these determinations the Commission shall examine:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(a)">(a)</span> The inmateâs prior criminal and juvenile record and the inmateâs response to prior incarceration, parole or probation, or both;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(b)">(b)</span> The inmateâs behavior and adjustment and the inmateâs participation in institutional and self-help programs, including progression to Division of Correction facilities with a less restrictive security classification;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(c)">(c)</span> The inmateâs vocational, educational, and other training;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(d)">(d)</span> The inmateâs current attitude toward society, discipline, and other authority, etc.;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(e)">(e)</span> The inmateâs past use of narcotics, alcohol, or dangerous controlled substances;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(f)">(f)</span> Whether the inmate has demonstrated emotional maturity and insight into the inmateâs problems;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(g)">(g)</span> Any reports or recommendations made by the sentencing judge, the institutional staff, or by a professional consultant such as a physician, psychologist, or psychiatrist;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(h)">(h)</span> The inmateâs employment plans, occupational skills, and job potential;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(i)">(i)</span> The inmateâs family status and stability;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(j)">(j)</span> The inmateâs ability and readiness to assume obligations and undertake responsibilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(k)">(k)</span> The adequacy of the inmateâs parole plan and the availability of resources to assist the inmate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(l)">(l)</span> The circumstances surrounding the crime, which diminish in significance as a consideration after the initial parole hearing; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(m)">(m)</span> Any other factors or information which the Commission may find relevant to the individual inmateâs consideration for parole.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> The Commission may recommend that an inmate serving a sentence for a crime committed while younger than 18 years old progress to a facility with a less restrictive security classification, as provided in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/12.08.01.18#E(4)" title="">Â§E(4) of this regulation</a>, and if the inmate:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(a)">(a)</span> Has completed all programming and treatment options available at the inmateâs current security level;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(b)">(b)</span> Would be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate parole suitability if placed in a lower security classification, or would benefit from the privileges, programming, and treatment programs that are available only at a less restrictive security classification; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(c)">(c)</span> Was previously found to be suitable for release by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> Any risk assessment tool used by the Commission for determining the risk of an inmate shall include dynamic risk factors as a method for assessing risk and shall require the healthcare professional administering the tool to exercise independent clinical judgment in assessing risk.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> In deciding whether to recommend parole for an inmate serving a sentence of life imprisonment, the Commission may not consider whether the inmate has successfully completed a period of work release if the inmate has never been eligible for work release.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Hearings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> An application for parole is not necessary, and an application need not be made by an inmate or on his behalf.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> A record shall be maintained of the mandatory hearing dates, noting on the record the time when each prisoner must receive parole consideration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> The Commission shall conduct hearings at the State penal and correctional institutions and the county jails and detention centers in accordance with a schedule to be determined by the Commission and as required by the laws of the State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing examiner, a commissioner acting as a hearing examiner, or by two or more commissioners in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements of each case.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> A parole hearing is actually an interview of the inmate, and attendance shall be restricted to parole personnel and a representative of the institution. On occasions, others may be invited by the Commission to attend, provided their attendance does not impede the prisoner being interviewed. The hearings are private and shall be held in an informal manner, allowing the prisoner the opportunity to give free expression to his views and feelings relating to his case. Formal presentations by an attorney, relatives, and others interested are not permitted at the parole hearings. Attorneys, relatives, and others who are interested in the inmate may discuss the relative merits or other factors of the case with the Commission at its executive offices, any time before or after a parole hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> A parole hearing conducted by a parole commissioner or hearing examiner shall be electronically or stenographically recorded to preserve a record for appeal.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(i)">(i)</span> Be destroyed 30 days after the hearing unless an appeal has been taken under the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/12.08.01.19" title=".19 Exception to Decision (Appeal).">Regulation .19 of this chapter</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(ii)">(ii)</span> In cases of appeal, be destroyed upon conclusion of the appeal hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> The recording of a parole hearing conducted for an inmate serving a life sentence for a crime committed while younger than 18 years old shall be retained until the conclusion of the inmateâs next parole hearing, or until the final disposition of any action seeking judicial review of the Commissionâs decision, whichever is later.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> Absent any unusual circumstances, the inmateâs classification counselor shall attend all hearings concerning that inmate.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Release on parole may not be granted unless recommended by a hearing examiner or acting hearing examiner and approved by a parole commissioner, or when required by law, by the affirmative vote of not less than two commissioners.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> When concurrence of at least two commissioners is required by law to grant parole, in the event of lack of concurrence, the case shall be continued and heard with a third commissioner present. The opinion of the majority shall represent the decision of the Commission.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> If a parole commissioner or hearing examiner determines that an inmate serving a life sentence for a crime committed while younger than 18 years old is nearing suitability for parole, the Commission shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)(i)">(i)</span> Indicate that determination within the inmateâs parole decision; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(10)(b)">(b)</span> A risk assessment has been received;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(10)(c)">(c)</span> The case will be considered en banc; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(10)(d)">(d)</span> The case has been forwarded to the Governor with a recommendation for parole.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(11)">(11)</span> Upon request from the inmate or the inmateâs representative, the Commission shall disclose to the inmate or the inmateâs representative the inmateâs current status in the parole process.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> A decision to parole does not become effective for release of the inmate until the parole order is presented and accepted by him.

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(a)">(a)</span> The Commission has specified a deferred release date; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)">(b)</span> The investigation of the community plan of the individual indicates that he would be without means of support, is likely to be unemployed upon his release, or is without a satisfactory home plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> A prisoner may not be released from confinement without an approved parole plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Special Conditions for Release. The Commission may, when it deems it necessary for the safety and welfare of the individual or the safety of the public, impose reasonable special conditions to be complied with before release on parole or from time to time during the period of parole supervision. These conditions shall be such that compliance can be accomplished by the exercise of reasonable effort by the parolee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Institutional Behavior Following Favorable Parole Action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)">(1)</span> When an effective date for release has been set by the Commission, release on that date is conditioned upon the continuance of good prison conduct. In those cases where the inmate's behavior is such that a re-evaluation of a previously established parole date should be made, it shall be the responsibility of the warden or superintendent of the institution of confinement to promptly provide the Commission with details of this behavior.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> Upon receipt of the information, the Commission may take such action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances including suspending release and rescheduling the inmate for an interview, after which the Commission may either cancel the parole order, delay the inmate's release, or grant the parole.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Early Initial Hearings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(1)">(1)</span> The Commission may, in its discretion, grant early initial parole hearings before the mandatory hearing date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(2)">(2)</span> The sentencing judge, the prosecuting attorney, or the inmate may write to the Commission requesting early parole hearings, setting forth the reasons for the request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(3)">(3)</span> Institutional personnel, over the signature of the warden or superintendent, or both, may write the Commission and request an early hearing, setting forth the reasons for the request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)">(4)</span> Wardens or superintendents, or both, may make recommendations for early parole hearings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(5)">(5)</span> The Commission may adopt a policy for uniform scheduling of hearings in advance of the mandatory date in accordance with such specific plan as it may from time to time establish.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)">(6)</span> Considerations of the Commission for early hearings are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(a)">(a)</span> The inmate's prior criminal record;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(b)">(b)</span> The nature and circumstances of the crime;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(c)">(c)</span> The length of the sentence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(d)">(d)</span> The amount of time served and the inmate's institutional adjustment;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(e)">(e)</span> The date of the inmate's regularly scheduled hearing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(f)">(f)</span> The reasons set forth in the request for an early hearing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)(g)">(g)</span> Adjustment to prior parole or probation supervision.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(7)">(7)</span> Authority to grant early initial hearings lies solely within the discretion of the Commission and cannot be delegated. Unless a uniform policy for advancing parole hearings has been adopted by the Commission, a hearing may not be advanced in individual cases except by a majority vote of those commissioners considering the question, and in any event, by at least three commissioners. An order to advance the hearing shall be in writing and included in the case file.</p>
