The Secretary shall make every effort to expedite approval in a minimum time period. Each student shall receive a completed copy of the enrollment contract signed by the student, the student's legal guardian if the student is under 18 years old, and an official of the school. The student shall also receive any other documents pertaining to the student's commitment to enroll.</p>

After the 7-day cancellation period, the refund policy given in §L(1) of this regulation shall be followed.</p>
