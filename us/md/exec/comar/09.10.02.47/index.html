                <p>Associations licensed by the Commission to conduct harness racing meetings may, with the approval of the Commission, conduct a so-called twin double, subject to the following rules:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The twin double is a part of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. It is a contract by each participant to pick (select) the winner of each of four races as may be designated by a licensee, with the approval of the Commission. For the purpose of this rule, the four races will be referred to as the "twin double races." The first two races so designated shall be referred to as the first half of the twin double. The third and fourth races so designated shall hereafter be referred to as the second half of the twin double. All sums deposited in the twin double shall be held in a single pool entirely separate from all other pools, and the award or dividend to each winning participant shall be calculated subject to the provisions of this rule, as in a straight pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> All twin double tickets shall be sold at properly designated windows and shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from the daily double and other tickets sold.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> All twin double tickets shall be sold only from automatic vending machines.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> The sale of twin double tickets may not commence until after the completion of the second race of the day, unless special permission is obtained from a representative of the Commission. The twin double windows shall close and the machines shall be locked 5 minutes before the official post time of the first race of the first half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Each participant in the twin double shall designate his selections as the winners of the first half of the twin double races at the time he purchases his twin double ticket, and each twin double ticket shall show the selections made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> After the completion of the first half of the twin double races, each participant holding a ticket or tickets combining the winners of this half of the twin double shall, during the period while the twin double windows are open for this purpose, exchange his ticket or tickets for a ticket or tickets showing his selections as the winners of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> A twin double exchange ticket may not be issued except upon the surrender of a twin double ticket showing the winners of the first half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Twin double windows shall be opened for the issue only of twin double exchange tickets after the races comprising the first half have been completed and declared official and shall close at the official post time of the start of the second half of the races comprising the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Before post time of the second race of the second half of the twin double races, there shall be posted or announced over the loud speaker system the pay-off of each combination coupled with the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double races. All such information shall be posted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> A winning twin double ticket not presented for exchange for a twin double exchange ticket within the period described in Â§H, above, may be presented for a refund of the purchase price (or award in the event that no participant selects the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double races), after completion of the first race of the second half of the twin double. The aggregate purchase price of all twin double tickets so entitled to a refund shall be deducted from the gross twin double pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> Inasmuch as the purpose of the twin double is to select winners of the first half and the second half of the twin double races, a participant who selects a horse which runs in but does not win a race is no longer eligible, unless no other participant has selected a winner of that race.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> If a horse is scratched in the first race of the first half of the twin double, all tickets on the scratched horse shall be refunded, and the money refunded will be deducted from the gross pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> If a horse is scratched in the second race of the first half of the twin double, after the running of the first race of the first half, all twin double tickets combining the scratched horse with the actual winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double shall be paid a price equivalent to that fraction of the net pool derived by dividing the net twin double pool (gross pool less commission) by the total number of tickets sold combining the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double with all horses in the second race of the first half of the twin double. The quotient thus obtained shall constitute the consolation pay-off to be paid to holders of each ticket combining the winner of the first race of the first half with the scratched horse in the second race of the first half. The entire consolation pool (number of eligible tickets times the consolation price), plus the breakage, shall then be deducted from the net twin double pool. The remaining pool is the new net pool for the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> If a horse is scratched in the first race of the second half of the twin double, during or after the exchange of tickets by holders of the first two winners, each ticket including the scratched horse in the first race of the second half shall be paid a price equivalent to that fraction of the net pool derived by dividing the net pool by the total number of exchanged tickets. The quotient thus obtained shall constitute the consolation pay-off to be paid to holders of tickets on the scratched horse. The entire consolation pool (number of eligible tickets times the consolation price), plus the breakage, shall be deducted from the net twin double pool to establish a new net pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O">O.</span> If a horse is scratched from the second race of the second half of the twin double after the first race of the second half has been run, each ticket including the scratched horse and the winner of the first race of the second half shall be paid a price equivalent to that fraction of the net pool derived by dividing the net pool by the total number of tickets combining the winner of the first race of the second half. The quotient thus obtained shall constitute a consolation pay-off. The entire consolation pool (number of eligible tickets times the consolation price), plus breakage, shall then be deducted from the net pool. The remaining pool shall be the new net pool for the final pay-off for the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="P">P.</span> If no ticket is sold combining the winner of the first race and the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double, the net pool shall then be apportioned between those having tickets, including the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double and those having tickets including the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double, and shall be calculated as a place pool. If this should happen, the twin double will terminate for that day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Q">Q.</span> If no ticket is sold including the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double, then the entire net pool shall be paid to holders of tickets which include the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double. If this should happen, the twin double will terminate for that day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="R">R.</span> If no ticket is sold including the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double, then the entire net pool shall be paid to holders of tickets which include the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double. If this should happen, the twin double will terminate for that day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="S">S.</span> If no exchange ticket includes the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double, the entire net pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to all holders of exchanged tickets and winning combinations of the first half that had not been exchanged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="T">T.</span> If no exchange ticket combines the winners of the first and second races of the second half of the twin double, then the entire net pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to holders of tickets including the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="U">U.</span> In the event of a dead heat in the first race of the first half of the twin double, all tickets combining both winners of the first race of the first half with the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double shall be eligible for exchange.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="V">V.</span> In the event of a dead heat in the second race of the first half of the twin double, all tickets combining the winning or winners of the first race of the first half with the winners of the second race of the first half of the twin double shall be eligible for exchange.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="W">W.</span> In the event of a dead heat in the first race of the second half of the twin double, if there is no ticket combining either winner with the winner of the second race of the second half of the twin double, then the pay-off shall be distributed to holders of tickets on the winners of the first race of the second half of the twin double in the same manner as a place pool is calculated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="X">X.</span> In the event of a dead heat in the second race of the second half of the twin double, the pay-off shall be distributed as a place pool to holders of tickets combining the winner of the first race of the second half with the winners of the second race of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Y">Y.</span> If, for any reason, the first race of the first half of the twin double is cancelled or declared "no race," full and complete refund shall be made of the twin double pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Z">Z.</span> If, for any reason, the second race of the first half of the twin double is cancelled or declared "no race," the net pool shall be calculated as a straight pool and shall be distributed to holders of tickets combining the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double with every horse in the second race of the first half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="AA">AA.</span> If, for any reason, the first race of the second half of the twin double is cancelled or declared "no race," the net pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to the holders of twin double exchange tickets and holders of winning twin double tickets not surrendered for exchange.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="BB">BB.</span> If, for any reason, the second race of the second half of the twin double is cancelled or declared "no race," the net pool shall be distributed as a straight pool among holders of exchange tickets designating the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="CC">CC.</span> Entries or field horses may not be allowed in any race included in the twin double, except by permission from a representative of the Commission.</p>
