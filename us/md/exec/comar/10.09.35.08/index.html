                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> The provider shall be paid the routine home care rate for each day the participant is under the care of the provider and another rate is not payable under §B(2)—(4) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)">(b)</span> The routine home care rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of covered services provided on a given day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(c)">(c)</span> The routine home care rate is paid at one of the following levels, whichever is applicable:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> For the day of discharge, payment shall be made at the routine or continuous home care rate, as appropriate, unless the participant dies as an inpatient; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> General Inpatient Care. The provider shall be paid the general inpatient care rate for each day the participant is in a qualified inpatient facility for care, subject to the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)(a)">(a)</span> The inpatient care is required for procedures necessary for pain control or for acute or chronic symptom management which cannot be provided in other settings;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Limitation on Payment for Inpatient Care.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Payment to a provider for inpatient care shall be limited according to the total number of days of inpatient care the provider furnished to participants during a specific cap period, excluding the days of inpatient care furnished to participants diagnosed with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> For the cap period, the aggregate number of inpatient days reimbursed for general inpatient and inpatient respite care (excluding inpatient days reimbursed for participants with AIDS) may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate total number of days of hospice care the provider furnished to all participants (excluding days of hospice care furnished to participants with AIDS) during the same period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> The limitation on payment for inpatient care days is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)">(a)</span> Subtract the days of care furnished to participants with AIDS from the total days of care furnished by the provider to all participants during the cap period;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(b)">(b)</span> Subtract the days of inpatient care furnished to participants with AIDS from the total days of inpatient care furnished by the provider to all participants during the cap period;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(c)">(c)</span> The maximum allowable number of reimbursable inpatient days is determined by multiplying by 0.2 the adjusted total number of days of hospice care the provider furnished to participants during the cap period, as determined in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.35.08#C(3)(a)" title="">§C(3)(a) of this regulation</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(d)">(d)</span> If the adjusted total number of inpatient care days the provider furnished to participants during the cap period, as determined in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.35.08#C(3)(b)" title="">§C(3)(b) of this regulation</a>, is less than or equal to the maximum allowable number of reimbursable inpatient days, no payment adjustment is necessary; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)">(e)</span> If the adjusted total number of inpatient care days the provider furnished to participants during the cap period exceeds the maximum allowable number of reimbursable inpatient days, the payment limitation and the refund to the Program shall be determined by:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)(i)">(i)</span> Calculating a ratio of the maximum allowable number of reimbursable inpatient days to the adjusted total number of inpatient care days, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement to the provider during the cap period for general inpatient and inpatient respite care days (minus the reimbursement for inpatient care days furnished to participants with AIDS);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)(ii)">(ii)</span> Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)(iii)">(iii)</span> Adding together the amounts calculated in §C(3)(e)(i) and (ii) of this regulation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)(iv)">(iv)</span> Refunding to the Program the difference between the interim reimbursement made for non-AIDS inpatient care during the cap period and the amount determined in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.35.08#C(3)(e)(iii)" title="">§C(3)(e)(iii) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> This limitation shall be applied once a year, at the end of the cap period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Service Intensity Add-On.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> In addition to the routine home care rate paid under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.35.08#B(1)" title="">§B(1) of this regulation</a>, the provider shall be paid for visits made by a social worker or a registered nurse, when provided during routine home care in the last 7 days of the participant’s life.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> The service intensity add-on payment is equal to the continuous home care hourly rate divided by four.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> The provider shall be paid in 15-minute increments for a maximum of four hours daily.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Payment for Physician Services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> The per diem rates are designed to reimburse for those administrative and general supervisory activities performed by physicians who are employees of or are working under arrangements with the provider. These activities are generally performed by the physician serving as the medical director or the physician member of the provider's interdisciplinary group. The included activities consist of participation in establishment of care plans, supervision of service delivery, periodic review and updating of care plans, and establishment of governing policies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> In addition to the daily rates, the Program shall make separate payment to the provider for physician services, subject to the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)(a)">(a)</span> The services shall be direct patient care services furnished to a participant under the care of the provider;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)(b)">(b)</span> The services shall be furnished by an employee of the provider or furnished under arrangements made by the provider;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)(c)">(c)</span> The provider shall have a liability to reimburse the physician for the services rendered;</p>
