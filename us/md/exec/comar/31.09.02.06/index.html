                <p>The following requirements apply to establishment and administration of variable life insurance separate accounts:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Establishment and Administration of Separate Accounts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> An insurer issuing variable life insurance in this State shall establish one or more separate accounts pursuant to Insurance Article, §§<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=16-601" title="">16-601</a>—<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=16-603" title="">16-603</a>, Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> Assets in the separate account shall be owned by the insurer and the insurer may not be, or hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to these assets. If and to the extent so provided under the applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of the separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the account may not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer may conduct.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> If no law or other regulation provides for the custody of separate account assets and if the insurer itself is not the custodian of these assets, all contracts for custody shall be in writing and the Commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile shall approve of both the terms of the contract and the proposed custodian before the transfer of custody.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Without the prior written approval of the Commissioner, an insurer may not employ in any material connection with the handling of separate account assets any person who:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(a)">(a)</span> Within the last 10 years has been convicted of any felony, or of a misdemeanor arising out of this person's conduct involving embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of funds or securities or involving violation of 18 U.S.C. §1341, 1342, or 1343;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(b)">(b)</span> Within the last 10 years has been found by any state regulatory authority to have violated or has acknowledged violation of any provision of any state insurance law involving fraud, deceit, or knowing misrepresentation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(c)">(c)</span> Within the last 10 years has been found by federal or state regulatory authorities to have violated, or has acknowledged violation of, any provision of federal or state securities laws involving fraud, deceit, or knowing misrepresentation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)(d)">(d)</span> Within the past 10 years has signed a consent order with any federal or state regulatory authority that it will not in the future engage in any of the aforementioned violations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> A person with access to the cash, securities, or other assets of the separate account shall be under bond in an amount of not less than the greater of $500,000 or 25 percent of the assets to which the person has access, but the bond need not exceed 5 million dollars.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> If an insurer establishes more than one separate account for variable life insurance, justification for the establishment of each additional separate account shall also be filed with the Commissioner and shall be subject to the Commissioner's approval. The creation of additional separate accounts to avoid lower maximum charges against the separate account is prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> The assets of the separate accounts established for variable life insurance policies shall be valued at least as often as variable benefits are determined but in any event at least monthly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> A separate account exempt pursuant to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, §3(c)(11), because of the tax qualified status of the policies funded thereby, may not be used to fund other variable life insurance policies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)">(9)</span> Except for separate accounts exempt pursuant to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, §3(c)(11), variable life insurance separate accounts may not be used for variable annuities or for the investment of funds corresponding to dividend accumulations or other policyholder liabilities not involving life contingencies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Amounts in the Separate Account.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The insurer shall maintain in each variable life insurance separate account assets with a fair market value at least equal to the greater of the valuation reserves for the variable portion of the variable life insurance policies or the benefit base for the policies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The benefit base of any variable life insurance policy as of the beginning of any valuation period may not be less than the sum of the following factors after deducting amounts of any indebtedness pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.02.04#E(2)" title="">Regulation .04E(2) of this chapter</a>:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> The valuation net premium for this period, for the variable portion of the policy, minus the discounted cost of term insurance for this period, based on the tabular mortality and interest rates used in determining valuation reserves; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> The valuation terminal reserve, for the variable portion of the policy, at the end of the immediately preceding valuation period adjusted for the net investment return of the preceding period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> In lieu of the minimum benefit base requirement specified in §B(1) and (2) of this regulation, an insurer may otherwise qualify under this section if it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the policy benefits obtained over a 20-year period from the date of issue by the use of the insurer's benefit base are at least substantially equivalent in value to the benefits obtained by the use of the minimum benefit base specified above. The Commissioner may specify the range of net investment return to be used in this demonstration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> Notwithstanding the actual reserve basis used for policies that do not meet standard underwriting requirements, the benefit base for these policies may be the same as for corresponding policies which do meet standard underwriting requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Investments by the Separate Account.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> A sale, exchange, or other transfer of assets may not be made by an insurer or any of its affiliates between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its separate accounts, unless:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> In case of a transfer into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the policies with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> The transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made by a transfer of cash, but other assets may be transferred if approved by the Commissioner in advance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Assets allocated to a variable life insurance separate account shall be held in cash or investments having a reasonably ascertainable market price.

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)(e)(ii)">(ii)</span> If the policy is in force as paid-up variable life insurance, then conversion will be to a substantially comparable paid-up fixed benefit life insurance policy for an amount of insurance not exceeding the death benefit of the variable life insurance policy on the date of conversion. If conversion is made pursuant to §F(2)(e)(i)(aa) or F(2)(e)(ii) of this regulation then:</p>
