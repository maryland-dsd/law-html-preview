                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> For small generator facilities at a site for which the applicant seeks a single point of interconnection, the interconnection request shall be evaluated for total exports on the basis of the net system capacity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> An interconnection request is required for the interconnection of a new small generator facility, or to increase the total exports, change the energy sales strategy pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/20.50.09.01#C" title="">Regulation .01C of this chapter</a>, or change the proposed use of an existing small generator facility. Any time a new interconnection request is processed for an existing small generator facility, the utility will apply any standards in effect at the time of the interconnection request and, if approved, a new interconnection agreement will be required. The interconnection request shall be evaluated on the basis of the total net system capacity of the small generator facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Utility Provided Information.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> A utility shall designate a contact person, and provide contact information on its website and for the Commission's website for submission of all interconnection requests, and from whom information on the interconnection request process and the utility's electric distribution system can be obtained.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> The information provided by the utility on its website shall include studies and other materials useful to an understanding of the feasibility of interconnecting a small generator facility on the utility electric distribution system, except to the extent providing the materials would violate security requirements or confidentiality agreements, or be contrary to law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> For projects with a nameplate capacity over 20kW, the utility shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)">(a)</span> Provide the applicant an opportunity to request a pre-application report, which may require payment of a fee listed in the utilityâs tariff;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(b)">(b)</span> Publicly post the fee amount on the utilityâs website; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(c)">(c)</span> Provide the pre-application report within 20 business days, once the fee is paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> The pre-application report shall rely largely on pre-existing utility data and shall, at a minimum, include the following items:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> In appropriate circumstances, the utility may require an applicant to execute an appropriate confidentiality agreement prior to release or access to confidential or restricted information.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> If an interconnection request is determined to be complete, any material modification, other than a minor equipment modification, that is not agreed to in writing by the utility, shall require submission of a new interconnection request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> If an applicant is not currently a customer of the utility at the location for the proposed small generator facility, upon request from the utility, the applicant shall provide proof of site control evidenced by a property tax bill, deed, lease agreement, contract, or other acceptable document.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Connection of Multiple Small Generator Facilities by Single Interconnection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> To minimize the cost of interconnecting multiple small generator facilities, the utility or the applicant may propose a single point of interconnection for multiple small generator facilities located at a single site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> If an applicant rejects a utility proposal for a single point of interconnection, the applicant shall pay any additional cost of providing separate points of interconnection for each small generator facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> If a utility unreasonably rejects a customer proposal for a single point of interconnection without providing a written technical explanation, the utility shall pay any additional cost of providing separate points of interconnection for each small generator facility.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> A small generator facility shall be capable of being isolated from the utility electric distribution system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> For a small generator facility interconnecting to a primary or secondary line, the isolation shall be by means of a lockable, visible-break isolation device accessible by the utility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> The isolation device shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the interconnection customer for the small generator facility, and located electrically between the small generator facility and the point of interconnection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> A draw-out type circuit breaker with a provision for padlocking at the draw-out position satisfies the requirement for an isolation device.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Use of Lockbox for Access to Isolation Device.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)">(1)</span> An interconnection customer may elect to provide the utility access to an isolation device that is contained in a building or area that may be unoccupied and locked or not otherwise readily accessible to the utility, by installing a lockbox provided by the utility that shall allow ready access to the isolation device.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> The lockbox shall be in a location that is readily accessible by the utility, and the interconnection customer shall permit the utility to affix a placard in a location of its choosing that provides clear instructions to utility operating personnel on access to the isolation device.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(3)">(3)</span> In the event the interconnection customer fails to comply with the terms of this section and the utility needs to gain access to the isolation device, the utility may not be held liable for any damages resulting from any necessary utility action to isolate the small generator facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Metering.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(1)">(1)</span> Any metering necessitated by a small generator facility interconnection shall be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the applicable utility tariff.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(2)">(2)</span> Any small generator facility metering requirements shall be clearly identified as part of the interconnection agreement executed by the interconnection customer and the utility.</p>
