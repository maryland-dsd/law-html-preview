Normally, extensions across streets or roads 70 feet or less in width shall be made at the expense of the utility and may not be considered in arriving at the length or cost of the extension to the applicant. However, in a special situation the applicant may be required to bear a part of the cost of crossing the street or road.</p>

The amount of the advance to the utility may not include any costs of increasing the size or capacity of the utility's existing mains or any other facilities used or necessary in connection with the proposed extension, except as provided in §L, below. If the actual cost of the extension is less than the estimated cost, the utility shall promptly refund to the applicant any overpayment.</p>

Refunds shall be made within 90 days after the new customer's service is connected and shall be made to the depositors who advanced the money for the extension. If more than one depositor is entitled to receive a refund, the total amount shall be divided in proportion to the amount of the unrefunded advance of each depositor.</p>
