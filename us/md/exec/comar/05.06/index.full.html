The qualified public agencies include the Community Development Administration of the Department of Housing and Community Development, which is the State housing finance agency, and may include other public agencies which operate housing finance programs satisfactory to the Fund and which would benefit by Fund insurance.</p>

The purpose of the Revitalization Program is to provide opportunities to lower the risk of lending by using M.H.F. insurance to stimulate the flow of private mortgage capital into areas which have suffered from decreasing homeownership and associated economic and social instability. In addition, the program makes homeownership possible for those who do not have the resources for a down payment and closing costs, both of which otherwise would be required without M.H.F. insurance.</p>

The Program demonstrated that the level of losses can be acceptable for high loan-to-value mortgages in older urban areas, and together with other factors contributed to the decrease of red-lining practices and the resurgence of private conventional mortgage lending in Baltimore City. The experience in Baltimore City also demonstrated the feasibility of extending the Program Statewide. Starting in 1978, the Program has been available Statewide.</p>
