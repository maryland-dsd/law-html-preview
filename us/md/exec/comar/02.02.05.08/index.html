                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> Before entering into the advisory contract and in addition to the requirements of Form ADV, the investment adviser shall disclose in writing to the client or the client's independent agent all material information concerning the proposed advisory arrangement, including the following:</p>
