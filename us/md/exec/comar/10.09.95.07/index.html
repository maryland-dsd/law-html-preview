                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Reimbursement Principles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> The Department will make no direct reimbursement to any State-operated hospital. The Department will claim federal fund recoveries from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for services to participants in State-operated hospitals.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> The Department shall compare the current rates with the projected upper payment limit for inpatient days of service on or after July 1, 2012, in freestanding private psychiatric hospitals in Maryland whose rates for commercial providers are set by the HSCRC.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> If the rates do not exceed the projected upper payment limit calculated by the Department, the Department shall reimburse these hospitals using a rate of 94 percent of the current rates for services set by the HSCRC for each hospital’s commercial providers in the fiscal year the prospective payments are made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> If the rates do exceed the projected upper payment limit calculated by the Department, the per diem payments to each such hospital shall be decreased by the same proportion that the projected upper payment limit is exceeded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> If the Program discontinues using rates which have been approved by HSCRC, the Program shall reimburse providers:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(a)">(a)</span> According to Medicare standards and principles for retrospective cost reimbursement described in 42 CFR §413; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(b)">(b)</span> On the basis of charges if less than reasonable cost.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> The Department may not reimburse for the services of a hospital’s salaried or contractual physicians as a separate line item. When HSCRC has included these salaries in the hospital’s costs, charges for these services shall be included in the room and board rate or the appropriate ancillary service only.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> Payment advances other than those made in accordance with HSCRC regulations may not be made routinely.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> Inpatient and outpatient services in District of Columbia special psychiatric and outpatient services in in-State special psychiatric hospitals are cost-settled on an annual basis according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.95.07#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)">(9)</span> Effective October 1, 2018, an out-of-State special psychiatric hospital shall be reimbursed the lesser of its charges or the amount reimbursable by the host state’s Title XIX agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)">(10)</span> An out-of-State provider shall submit proof of host state rates on an annual basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Retrospective Cost Reimbursement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Except as specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.95.07#A" title="">§A of this regulation</a>, a special psychiatric hospital not approved by the Program for reimbursement according to HSCRC rates shall be reimbursed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> According to Medicare standards and principles for retrospective cost reimbursement described in 42 CFR §413; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)">(b)</span> On the basis of charges, if less than reasonable cost.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> In calculating retrospective cost reimbursement rates, the Department or its designee will deduct from the designated costs or group of costs those restricted contributions which are designated by the donor for paying certain provider operating costs, groups of costs, or costs of specific groups of participants. When the cost, or group or groups of costs designated, cover services rendered to all participants, including Medical Assistance participants, operating costs applicable to all participants shall be reduced by the amount of the restricted grants, gifts, or income from endowments thus resulting in a reduction of allowable costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> Final settlement for services in the provider’s fiscal year shall be determined based on Medicare retrospective cost principles found at 42 CFR §413, adjusted for Medicaid allowable costs. Allowable costs specific to the Program shall be limited to a base-year cost per discharge increased by the applicable federal rate of increase times the number of Program discharges for that fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> Base Year. For purposes of determining limits on the increase of cost, in accordance with Medicare regulations, the base year shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)(a)">(a)</span> For an existing provider, the first year of entering into the Program or the first year separate rates for the unit or units of service or services are approved; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)(b)">(b)</span> For a new provider, or all of these, the 12-month period immediately before the provider was initially subjected to target rate increases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> Initial Interim Rates. In order to establish an initial interim rate, the provider shall submit to the Department or its designee, before the beginning of the first billing period, at least 90 days before the beginning of billing for services, the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)">(a)</span> A detailed cost build-up, consistent with Medicare principles and cost finding, that supports the requested rate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(b)">(b)</span> A current, projected, and prior year’s charge rate schedule;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(c)">(c)</span> Finalized prior year’s Medicare cost reports and the most current submission;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(d)">(d)</span> A detailed revenue schedule; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(e)">(e)</span> Audited financial statements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> The provider shall supply the Department or its designee the assurances necessary to establish that its customary charges to participants liable for payment on a charge basis exceed the allowable cost for these services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> Initial Interim Rates for Newly Established Services or Providers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(a)">(a)</span> The provider shall submit to the Department or its designee, a detailed cost build-up, consistent with Medicare principles and cost finding, that supports the requested rate that follows Medicare principles and cost finding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(b)">(b)</span> The Department will compare the rate with a compatible facility and determine a reasonable rate that does not exceed the projected charges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> Revision of Interim Rates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(a)">(a)</span> The provider may request an interim rate revision should the actual and projected cost exceed the interim rate by 10 percent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(b)">(b)</span> The provider shall furnish the Department or its designee with appropriate schedules showing the reason for the increase and other any other information that supports the rate increase.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(c)">(c)</span> The Department will lower the provider’s interim rate to approximate the final allowable reasonable cost based on the results of the prior year’s review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(d)">(d)</span> The provider may request not more than two interim rate revisions during the accounting year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> Cost Settlement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(a)">(a)</span> The provider shall submit to the Department or its designee:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(a)(i)">(i)</span> A Medicaid cost report based on actual data using the cost reporting forms used by Medicare for retrospective cost reimbursement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> A copy of the provider’s Program log; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> A finalized Medicare cost report for the cost reporting year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(b)">(b)</span> The final Program cost report shall be sufficiently detailed to support a separate cost finding for Maryland Medical Assistance unique cost centers. The provider shall also submit a copy of its Maryland Medical Assistance log. The submitted cost report shall be in sufficient detail to support a separate cost finding for designated Maryland Medical Assistance unique cost centers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(c)">(c)</span> Tentative cost settlements may not be performed on a routine basis. However, the Program may, when it determines appropriate, calculate tentative settlements. The provider shall furnish the Department or its designee with a finalized Medicare cost report for the cost reporting year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(d)">(d)</span> The Department will base final settlement on the results of the finalized Medicare cost reports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> The Program shall reimburse room and board charges for the day of admission, but may not reimburse room and board charges for the day of discharge from the hospital.</p>
