                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C1a">a.</span> Integrate available automation and technology to streamline administrative tasks, enhance contract monitoring mechanisms, and ensure compliance and implementation of contract management software and technology tools;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C1d">d.</span> Include a mechanism for vendors and procurement officers to provide feedback, identify bottlenecks, address challenges, and facilitate a continuous cycle of improvement within the procurement process;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C2a">a.</span> For routine procurements, developing a 120-day procurement lead time from the date the procurement package is complete to the date the award is recommended.

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C2b">b.</span> Expanding the use of contract vehicles with pre-approved vendors, including CSBs, to accelerate the procurement process for routine purchases while maintaining a robust and diverse supplier base;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D5">5.</span> GOSBA and MDOT, in consultation with the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”), shall determine if there is an opportunity to streamline the certification process to accept firms certified as 8(a) Program participants, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (“VOSB”), and Women-Owned Small Businesses (“WOSB”) by the SBA into the Maryland MBE and VSBE programs.</p>
