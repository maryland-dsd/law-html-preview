                <p>These regulations govern implementation by the Maryland Historical Trust of Ch. 645, Acts of 1992, known as the Transfer of Human Remains Held by the Maryland Historical Trust Act and codified as <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gsf&amp;section=5A-339" title="">State Finance and Procurement Article, §5A-339, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>. The Act permits the Maryland Historical Trust to permanently transfer human remains and associated funerary objects in its possession, custody, or control to descendants and culturally affiliated groups. The Act also permits the Trust to temporarily transfer human remains and associated funerary objects to certain qualifying organizations or institutions for purposes of study. To the extent reasonably possible based on information known to the Trust, these regulations assure that transfers of human remains and associated funerary objects by the Trust, when permitted by the Act, occur with notice to and advice and input from lineal descendants, culturally affiliated groups, and other interested entities.</p>
