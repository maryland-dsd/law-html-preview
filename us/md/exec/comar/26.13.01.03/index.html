                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> ”Boiler” means an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion and having one of the following characteristics:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)">(a)</span> The unit satisfies all of the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The unit shall have physical provisions for recovering and exporting thermal energy in the form of steam, heated fluids, or heated gases.</p>

However, secondary energy recovery equipment such as economizers or air preheaters need not be physically formed into the same unit as the combustion chamber and the primary energy recovery section. Process heaters which are units that transfer energy directly to a process stream and fluidized bed combustion units are not precluded from being boilers solely because they are not of integral design.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> While in operation, the unit shall maintain a thermal energy recovery efficiency of at least 60 percent, calculated in terms of the recovered energy compared with the thermal value of the fuel.</p>

In this calculation, credit may not be given for recovered heat used internally in the same unit. Examples of internal use are the preheating of fuel or combustion air, and the driving of induced or forced draft fans or feedwater pumps.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(b)">(b)</span> The unit is one which the Secretary has determined, on a case-by-case basis, to be a boiler, after considering the standards in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.01.04#F" title="">Regulation .04F of this chapter</a>.</p>
