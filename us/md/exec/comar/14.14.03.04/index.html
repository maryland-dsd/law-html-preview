                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> "Adjudicative fact" means facts which involve a particular party or facility and have no general applicability--for example, the types and quantities of pollutant emissions which one facility will have.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> "Adjudicatory hearing" means a contested case hearing conducted pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> "Requester" means the person requesting an adjudicatory hearing who seeks to or has become a party to the proceedings, and whose legal rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges are adversely affected by the decision of the Board on an application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Requests for Adjudicatory Hearings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Within 50 calendar days from the date of publication in the Maryland Register of the notice of the completed application, persons requesting an adjudicatory hearing shall submit to the Secretary, in writing, specific grounds for their grievances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> Requesters for adjudicatory hearings shall do all of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> State the name, address, and telephone number of the person making the request;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> Identify the specific rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges of the requester which are adversely affected by the application for which the adjudicatory hearing is requested, and upon which the requester asserts his or her grievance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> Identify any other person whom the requester represents;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(d)">(d)</span> State separately and specifically the issues of adjudicative fact proposed to be considered at the hearing; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(e)">(e)</span> Describe the data and information which, if established through relevant and competent evidence at the hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue(s) in the way sought by the person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Board's Consideration of Requests.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> The Board shall consider any requests for an adjudicatory hearing promptly and give notice of its decision to requesters by certified mail. Before an adjudicatory hearing is granted, the Board may request briefs from all requesters on the issue of standing or other threshold issues. The Board or its hearing officer will determine which parties will have standing as to each issue. Any requester may be admitted as a party for limited purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Requests for an adjudicatory hearing will be granted if the requester has shown all of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(a)">(a)</span> There is a genuine issue of material adjudicative fact for resolution at a hearing. An adjudicatory hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law or on issues of fact which are of no consequence to the determination of whether or not a certificate should issue.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)">(b)</span> The factual issue is capable of being resolved by available and specifically identified evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations or denial or general descriptions of positions and contentions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(c)">(c)</span> The data and information identified in the request for hearing, if established through relevant and competent evidence at a hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Board concludes that, even assuming the truth and accuracy of all of the data and information submitted in support of the objection and request for hearings, they are insufficient to justify the factual determination urged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Pre-hearing Conference.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> The hearing officer may hold a pre-hearing conference to determine standing or any other preliminary matters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> At the discretion of the hearing officer, persons other than parties may attend pre-hearing conferences.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> At a pre-hearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the hearing officer, each party shall make available to the other parties the names of experts and other witnesses the party expects to call, together with a brief written summary of their anticipated testimony.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)">(4)</span> At a pre-hearing conference, or within some reasonable time set by the hearing officer, the following matters shall be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(a)">(a)</span> The documents within the Board's file shall be identified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(b)">(b)</span> Stipulations and admissions of facts and the genuineness of documents and other matters upon which there is agreement shall be identified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(c)">(c)</span> Matters of which official notice may be taken shall be identified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(d)">(d)</span> Disputed issues of a purely legal nature shall be identified and submitted by the hearing officer to the Attorney General.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(e)">(e)</span> Disputed issues of policy shall be identified and deferred for consideration until the public hearing held on the application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(f)">(f)</span> Disputed issues of fact which concern technical matters (plans, specifications, construction drawings, process controls, operation procedures, etc.) subject to determination by the Department in connection with issuance of a facility or discharge permit may be deferred, at the hearing officer's sole discretion, to the Department with the Department's concurrence. Until the resolution of the disputed factual issue by the Department or issuance of necessary permits, the Board shall presume resolution of the disputed fact in a manner consistent with issuance of the certificate. Post-permit review by the Board shall be as set forth in Regulation .07E.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(g)">(g)</span> When possible, consideration shall be given to and decisions made upon objections to the introduction into evidence at the hearing of any written documents, papers, exhibits, testimony, or materials proposed to be introduced at the hearing by a party. The hearing officer may determine to receive evidence on an issue by issue basis. To the extent possible, parties of like interest in the application shall consolidate the presentation of their cases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(h)">(h)</span> A schedule of presentation order for the following shall be established:</p>

The burden of production on any specific issue may vary between the parties at the discretion of the hearing officer. The hearing officer may issue a summary dismissal of any issue of fact after presentation of a party's case when, even assuming the truth and accuracy of all evidence submitted by that party, it is insufficient to justify the factual determination urged. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion on all factual issues adjudicated.</p>
