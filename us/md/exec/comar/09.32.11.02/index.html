                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Issues. The Hearing Examiner shall inquire fully into the facts of the particular case.

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Representation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> An interested party may appear without representation in any proceeding before a Hearing Examiner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> A party may be represented by an attorney admitted to practice by the Maryland Court of Appeals or by an authorized representative.

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Attorney’s Fees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)">(1)</span> An attorney representing a claimant in any proceeding before a Hearing Examiner may not charge a fee in excess of 200 percent of the claimant’s weekly benefit amount per case without the approval of the Chief Hearing Examiner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> Requests for approval of fees greater than 200 percent of the claimant’s weekly benefit amount shall be accompanied by an itemized account of services rendered in the case. A request for the excess fee shall be submitted within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of the decision. The Chief Hearing Examiner shall have authority to approve a fee higher than the maximum allowed under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/09.32.11.02#H(1)" title="">§H(1) of this regulation</a> based upon the complexity of the case and the reasonableness of the fee.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(3)">(3)</span> The fee amounts set out in §H(1) and (2) of this regulation may be awarded for each level of appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(4)">(4)</span> Although the maximum fee allowed is governed by these regulations, payment of the fee allowed is a private matter left solely to the claimant and the claimant’s attorney.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Appointment of Interpreter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(1)">(1)</span> If a party or witness is hearing-impaired or mute, and because of this impediment cannot readily understand or communicate the spoken language, or if the party or witness is unable to communicate in the English language, the party or witness may apply to the Chief Hearing Examiner for the appointment of a qualified interpreter to assist that person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(2)">(2)</span> Upon application of the party or witness, the Chief Hearing Examiner shall appoint a qualified interpreter to assist that person.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(3)">(3)</span> In selecting a qualified interpreter for appointment, the Chief Hearing Examiner may consult any directory of interpreters maintained by any court in this State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)">(4)</span> An interpreter, appointed pursuant to this section, shall be allowed reasonable compensation subject to approval of the Chief Hearing Examiner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> Evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)">(1)</span> Rules of Evidence. The hearings shall be conducted informally in a manner to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties.  The Hearing Examiner is not bound by common law or statutory rules as to the admissibility of evidence or by technical rules of procedures. Witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(2)">(2)</span> Electronically Stored Records. A party who seeks to enter into evidence videotapes, audiotapes, or other electronically stored records shall produce at the hearing the equipment necessary to allow review of the contents of the records. The party offering the records shall have the continuing obligation to produce the equipment necessary to review the records if further administrative proceedings occur. If the party offering the records fails to produce the equipment necessary to review the records, the Hearing Examiner may exclude the records from consideration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(3)">(3)</span> Agency Record. For purposes of an appeal from a claims examiner's determination, the official Agency record shall consist of the appeal letter and envelope or other evidence showing its manner of submission, and the Agency Fact Finding Report. For purposes of an appeal from a review determination, the official Agency record shall consist of the appeal letter and envelope or other evidence showing its manner of submission, and the review determination under review. Upon request of a party to an appeal for information from other records of the Department, the Hearing Examiner shall forward the request to the Secretary so that information that may be relevant and pertinent and that is not by definition a part of the Agency record, may be furnished by the Secretary. Upon request, any party shall be furnished with any information contained in the official Agency record, or other Agency documents in the custody of the Secretary that may be pertinent or material to the case. Requests for this information shall be made at least 3 business days before the hearing and shall state, as nearly as possible, the nature of the information desired. Requests made after this time will be granted only at the discretion of the scheduling authority. The records of the Maryland Department of Labor shall be deemed self-authenticating for purposes of admission under the Rules of Evidence. The Hearing Examiner shall admit the Agency record, including the Agency Fact-Finding Report, into evidence at the hearing, without the need for an Agency representative to appear at the hearing to authenticate or introduce it. The Hearing Examiner shall consider the Agency record when making a final decision, giving weight to the Agency Fact-Finding Report that the Hearing Examiner deems appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(4)">(4)</span> Evidence of Medical Condition. In any case where the medical condition of a party is at issue, the Hearing Examiner, for good cause shown, may grant a party up to 10 calendar days after the hearing to submit written medical documentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> Subpoenas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)">(1)</span> The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas, to be served by first-class mail, or by any individual who is not a party and who is at least 18 years of age, to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, and other records deemed necessary as evidence in writing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)">(2)</span> The scheduling authority may deny requests for subpoenas that request irrelevant information, or are frivolous or unreasonably burdensome to the other party.  A request for a subpoena may not be denied without substantial cause.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)">(3)</span> Requests for subpoenas shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)(a)">(a)</span> Be in writing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)(b)">(b)</span> State the name and address of the person to be subpoenaed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)(c)">(c)</span> State with specificity the documents to be produced;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)(d)">(d)</span> State the reason for the request; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(3)(e)">(e)</span> Be delivered to the scheduling authority at least 5 business days before the date of the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> Procedure at Hearing. The Hearing Examiner may call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses and may introduce into the record documentary or other evidence. The parties to the hearing shall be given an opportunity to call witnesses on their own behalf, cross-examine witnesses, inspect documents, and offer evidence in explanation or rebuttal. The Hearing Examiner may order the taking of additional testimony as the Hearing Examiner considers necessary. Upon the request of any party at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall grant a reasonable time for oral argument by the interested parties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> Continuance of Hearing. The Hearing Examiner may continue any hearing and make any direction or instruction necessary for the efficient disposition of the matter at the Hearing Examiner’s discretion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Withdrawal of Appeals. At any time before the hearing, a party appealing from a determination of a claims examiner or appealing a review determination may request that the appeal be withdrawn, and the Hearing Examiner shall permit the withdrawal. After the hearing has commenced or concluded, a withdrawal may be permitted for good cause shown. A request for withdrawal shall be submitted in writing or placed on the record during a hearing. An approved withdrawal is a final decision and is not subject to a request to reopen.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O">O.</span> Dismissal of Appeal When Appealing Party Fails to Appear. If a party appealing the determination of a claims examiner or appealing a review determination fails to appear at a hearing after having been given the required notice, the Hearing Examiner may issue a decision on the facts available or may dismiss the appeal. Failure to be present at the location designated for the hearing within 10 minutes of the time scheduled shall be considered a failure to appear within the meaning of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="P">P.</span> Request by Appealing Party to Reopen Dismissed Case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(1)">(1)</span> A request to reopen a dismissed case shall be in writing and a copy shall be sent to the opposing party.  Failure to notify the opposing party does not affect the timeliness of the request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(2)">(2)</span> A request to reopen a case may be granted for the following reasons:</p>
