                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> An acute rehabilitation hospital not approved by the Program for reimbursement according to HSCRC rates shall be reimbursed according to Medicare standards and principles for retrospective cost reimbursement described in 42 CFR §413, or on the basis of charges if less than reasonable cost.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> In calculating retrospective cost reimbursement rates, the Department or its designee will deduct from the designated costs or group of costs those restricted contributions which are designated by the donor for paying certain provider operating costs, or groups of costs, or costs of specific groups of participants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> When the cost, or group or groups of costs designated, cover services rendered to all participants, including Medical Assistance participants, operating costs applicable to all participants shall be reduced by the amount of the restricted grants, gifts, or income from endowments, thus resulting in a reduction of allowable costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Final settlement for services in the provider’s fiscal year shall be determined based on Medicare retrospective cost principles found in 42 CFR §413, adjusted for Medicaid allowable costs. Allowable costs specific to the Program shall be limited to a base year cost per discharge increased by the applicable federal rate of increase times the number of Program discharges for that fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> Base Year. For purposes of determining limits on the increase of cost, in accordance with Medicare regulations, the base year shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(a)">(a)</span> For an existing provider, the first year of entering into the Program or the first year separate rates for the unit or units of service or services are approved; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)(b)">(b)</span> For a new provider, the 12-month period immediately before the provider was initially subject to target rate increases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> Initial Interim Rates. In order to establish an initial interim rate, the provider shall submit to the Department or its designee, before the beginning of the first billing period, the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(a)">(a)</span> A detailed cost build-up, consistent with Medicare principles and cost finding, that supports the requested rate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(b)">(b)</span> A current, projected, and prior year’s charge rate schedule;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(c)">(c)</span> Finalized prior year’s Medicare cost reports and the most current submission;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(d)">(d)</span> A detailed revenue schedule; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(e)">(e)</span> Audited financial statements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> The provider shall supply the Department or its designee the assurances necessary to establish that its customary charges to participants liable for payment on a charge basis exceed the allowable cost for these services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> Initial Interim Rates for Newly Established Services or Providers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)(a)">(a)</span> The provider shall submit to the Department or its designee, a detailed cost build-up, consistent with Medicare principles and cost finding that supports the requested rate that follows.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)(b)">(b)</span> The Department will compare the rate with a compatible facility and determine a reasonable rate that does not exceed the projected charges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)">(9)</span> Revision of Interim Rates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)(a)">(a)</span> The provider may request an interim rate revision if the actual and projected costs exceed the interim rate by 10 percent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)(b)">(b)</span> The provider shall furnish the Department or its designee with appropriate documentation showing the reason for the increase and other necessary comparisons.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)(c)">(c)</span> The Department will lower the provider’s interim rate to closely approximate the final allowable reasonable cost based on the results of the prior year’s review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(9)(d)">(d)</span> The provider may request no more than one interim rate revision during the provider’s fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)">(10)</span> Cost Settlement. The provider shall submit to the Department or its designee:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)(a)">(a)</span> A Medicaid cost report based on actual data using the cost reporting forms used by Medicare for retrospective cost reimbursement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)(b)">(b)</span> A copy of its Maryland Medical Assistance log;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)(c)">(c)</span> Cost reports that are sufficient in detail to support a separate cost finding for designated Maryland Medical Assistance unique cost centers; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(10)(d)">(d)</span> A finalized Medicare cost report for the cost reporting year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(11)">(11)</span> Final Program costs shall be Maryland Medical Assistance specific.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(12)">(12)</span> Tentative cost settlements may not be performed on a routine basis. However, the Program reserves the right to calculate tentative settlements in limited cases, when appropriate, as determined by the Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(13)">(13)</span> The Department will base final settlement on the results of the finalized Medicare cost reports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> The Department or its designee shall notify each provider participating in the Program of the results of the final settlement under §A(10)—(13) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Within 60 days after the provider receives the notification described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.92.10#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a>, the Department shall pay the amount due to the provider regardless of whether the provider files an appeal.</p>
