                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> A policy or certificate may not be advertised, solicited, delivered, or issued for delivery in this State as a Medicare supplement policy or certificate on or after June 1, 2010, unless it complies with the benefit standards found in this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> An issuer may not offer a 1990 standardized Medicare supplement benefit plan for sale on or after June 1, 2010. Benefit standards applicable to Medicare supplement policies and certificates issued with an effective date for coverage before June 1, 2010, remain subject to the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08" title=".08 Benefit Standards for 1990 Standardized Medicare Supplement Benefit Plans.">Regulation .08 of this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Required Standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The standards in this section apply to Medicare supplement policies and certificates and are in addition to all other requirements of this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not exclude or limit benefits for a loss incurred more than 6 months after the effective date of coverage because the loss involved a preexisting condition. The policy or certificate may not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within 6 months before the effective date of coverage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts. Premiums may be modified to correspond with the changes to the cost-sharing amounts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> Each Medicare supplement policy shall be guaranteed renewable. The issuer may not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(a)">(a)</span> Cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of the health status of the individual; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(b)">(b)</span> Cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> If the Medicare supplement policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.27#B(9)" title="">§B(9) of this regulation</a>, the issuer shall offer each certificate holder an individual Medicare supplement policy, which at the option of the certificate holder provides for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(a)">(a)</span> Continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(b)">(b)</span> Benefits that meet the requirements of these regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> If an individual is a certificate holder in a group Medicare supplement policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(a)">(a)</span> Offer the certificate holder the conversion option described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.27#B(7)" title="">§B(7) of this regulation</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(b)">(b)</span> At the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificate holder continuation of coverage under the group policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by another group Medicare supplement policy purchased by the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to each individual covered under the old group policy on the group policy's date of termination. Coverage under the new policy may not result in an exclusion for a preexisting condition that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)">(10)</span> Extension of Benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(a)">(a)</span> Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be without prejudice to a continuous loss that commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in force may be conditioned on the continuous total disability of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(b)">(b)</span> Receipt of Medicare Part D benefits may not be considered in determining a continuous loss under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.27#B(10)(a)" title="">§B(10)(a) of this regulation</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(c)">(c)</span> A Medicare supplement policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended, for any period that may be provided by federal regulation, at the request of the policyholder, if the policyholder is:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Entitled to benefits under §226 (b) of the Social Security Act; and</p>
