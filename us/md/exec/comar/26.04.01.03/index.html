                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The Approving Authority may grant to a supplier of water a variance or variances from certain requirements of this chapter. The requirements for obtaining variances are as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> The Approving Authority may issue a variance based on the condition that the supplier of water installs the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means, which the Approving Authority finds are available when taking costs into consideration, and based upon an evaluation that indicates that alternative sources of water are not reasonably available;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> The Approving Authority may issue a variance to a supplier of water after documentation and consideration of findings set in 40 CFR §142.20;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> The Approving Authority may issue to systems serving fewer than 10,000 persons a variance from a maximum contaminant level, or a treatment technique in accordance with 40 CFR §§142.301—142.313, Subpart K, except for microbial contaminants that are included in subparts H, P, S, T, W, and Y of the 40 CFR §141.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Variances from the treatment technique requirements of 40 CFR §141, Subpart H, may not be granted;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> Variances from the total coliform and E. coli maximum contamination levels may not be granted; beginning April 1, 2016 the total coliform maximum contaminant level is no longer effective;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> Variances from a maximum contaminant level for any synthetic organic chemical may only be granted if the:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(a)">(a)</span> Conditions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.03#A(4)" title="">§A(4) of this regulation</a> are met; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)(b)">(b)</span> Requirements of Regulation .03-1 of this chapter are met;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)">(7)</span> Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, variances from a maximum contaminant level may be granted if the Approving Authority finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)(a)">(a)</span> Characteristics of the raw water sources (which are reasonably available to the system) are such that the system cannot meet the requirements respecting the maximum contaminant levels of this regulation when application has been made of the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means, which the Approving Authority finds are generally available, taking costs into consideration; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(7)(b)">(b)</span> The granting of a variance does not result in an unreasonable risk to the health of persons served by the system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(8)">(8)</span> Variances for a treatment technique other than treatment technique requirements of 40 CFR §141, Subpart H, may be granted if the Approving Authority finds that the supplier of water applying for the variance has demonstrated that the treatment technique is not necessary to protect the health of persons because of the nature of the raw water source of the system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> A supplier of water may request the granting of a variance under this regulation for a public water system by submitting a request for a variance in writing to the Approving Authority. The written request shall include the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The nature and duration of the variance requested.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)">(a)</span> Explanation in full and evidence that application of the best available treatment technology and techniques has been made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)">(b)</span> Economic and legal factors relevant to ability or inability to comply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(c)">(c)</span> Analytical results of alternate raw water quality relevant to the variance request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)">(d)</span> A proposed compliance schedule, including the date each step toward compliance will be achieved. The schedule includes as a minimum the following dates:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)(i)">(i)</span> The date by which arrangement for alternate raw water source or improvement of existing raw water source will be completed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> The date of initiation of the connection of the alternate raw water source or improvement of existing raw water source; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)(iii)">(iii)</span> The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(e)">(e)</span> A plan for the provision of safe drinking water in the case of an excessive rise in the contaminant level for which the variance is requested.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)">(f)</span> A plan for interim control measures during the effective period of variance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> For a request made under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.03#A(2)" title="">§A(2) of this regulation</a>, a statement that the supplier of water will perform monitoring and other reasonable requirements prescribed by the Approving Authority as a condition of the variance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the applicant and other information required by the Approving Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> The Approving Authority shall act on any variance request submitted under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.03#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a> within 90 days after receipt of the request and all necessary information. In addition, before acting on a request for a variance from:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> An MCL, the Approving Authority shall consider such factors as the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> The availability and effectiveness of treatment methods for the contaminant for which the variance is requested; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> Cost and other economic considerations such as implementing treatment, improving the quality of the source of water, or using an alternate source;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> A required treatment technique, because this treatment is unnecessary to protect the public health, the Approving Authority shall consider such factors as the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(a)">(a)</span> Quality of the water source, including pertinent sources of pollution; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)">(b)</span> Source protection measures employed by the supplier of water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> If the Approving Authority decides to deny the application for a variance, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the intention to issue a denial. The notice shall include a statement of reasons for the proposed denial, and shall offer the applicant an opportunity to present, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, additional information or argument to the Approving Authority. The Approving Authority shall make a final determination on the request within 30 days after receiving additional information or argument.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> If the Approving Authority proposes to grant a variance request submitted under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.03#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a>, the applicant shall be notified of the decision in writing. The notice shall identify  the proposed variance, the facility covered, and the period of time for which the proposed variance will be effective. In addition, for a variance from a:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Maximum contaminant level, the notice shall provide that the variance will be terminated when the supplier of water complies with the applicable standard, and may be terminated upon a finding by the Approving Authority that the supplier of water has failed to comply with any requirements of a final schedule approved by the Approving Authority;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Treatment technique, the notice shall provide that the variance may be terminated at any time upon a finding that the nature of the raw water source is such that the application of the treatment technique for which the variance was granted is necessary to protect the health of individuals, or if the supplier of water has failed to comply with any of the conditions prescribed by the Approving Authority, as a condition to the granting of the variance.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> If the supplier of water has no access to an alternate raw water source, and can effect or anticipate no adequate improvement of the existing raw water source, the proposed schedule may specify an indefinite time period for compliance until a new and effective treatment technology is developed at which time a new compliance schedule shall be prescribed by the Approving Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(4)">(4)</span> The proposed schedule for implementation of interim control measures during the period of variance shall specify interim treatment techniques, methods and equipment, and dates by which steps toward meeting the interim control measures are to be met.</p>
