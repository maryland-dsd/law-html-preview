Receipts derived from securities brokerages services allocable to this State are determined by multiplying the total dollar amount of sales of securities brokerage services by a fraction, the numerator of which is the receipts from securities brokerage services from customers domiciled in this State and the denominator of which is the receipts from securities brokerage services from all customers. Receipts from securities brokerage services include commissions on transactions, the spread earned on principal transactions in which the broker buys or sells from its account, total margin interest paid on behalf of brokerage accounts owned by the broker's customers, and fees and receipts of all kinds from the underwriting of securities. For principal transactions that are part of brokerage receipts, if the income from these transactions can be tied to, or associated with, an identifiable customer that provides the impetus for the transaction, the receipt shall be assigned to the domicile of that customer. If it is impossible to identify or associate a specific customer with a receipt, the receipt shall be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the receipts factor. If receipts from brokerage services can be associated with a particular customer, but it is impractical to associate the receipts with the address of the customer, the customer shall be presumed to have a domicile at the branch office that generates transactions for the customer.</p>
                <p>Example 7: Broker A executes a transaction on a stock exchange for Customer B, a Maryland domiciliary, selling 100 shares of Corporation X for $1,000 and earning a $50 commission on the transaction. The commission is included in the numerator of A's sales factor.</p>
                <p>Example 8: Broker C executes a transaction for Customer E, a domiciliary of Maryland, whereby C sells to E securities from its own account. Broker C's purchase cost is $1,000 and sales price is $1,025. The spread of $25 is included in the numerator of C's sales factor. This example illustrates two principles. First, only net proceeds, not gross proceeds, from principal transactions in which the broker sells from its own account are included in the sales factor. Second, the net amount is included in the sales factor numerator because Customer E, a domiciliary of Maryland, is the principle impetus for the transaction.</p>
