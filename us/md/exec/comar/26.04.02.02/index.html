                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> If a community sewerage system is adequate and economically available to the building to be served, the Approving Authority may require a connection to the system.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of this regulation, the Department may approve an on-site sewage disposal system:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> For a lot or parcel that was recorded and approved by the Department on or before November 17, 1985 if it meets the Department’s regulations and policies that were in effect on November 17, 1985, and has at least one replacement system area; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> For a lot or parcel that was recorded and approved by the Department on or before November 18, 1985 and was approved subject to a 10,000 square foot or greater disposal area, if it meets the other requirements and policies that were in effect on November 17, 1985. However, if a lot was approved subject to a 10,000 square foot disposal area, this disposal area is required; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(c)">(c)</span> For a lot that was recorded without Department approval before November 18, 1985, if it meets the other requirements of this regulation except that only area sufficient for an initial and one replacement system is required for the lot’s initial dwelling unit. A 10,000 square foot area sufficient for an initial system installation and two replacement systems is required for each additional dwelling unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> If the Department has approved a county’s groundwater protection plan, a sewage disposal system may be installed with less than a 4-foot treatment zone in a coastal plain county if the system complies with a groundwater protection report incorporated in the county’s master water and sewerage plan. These counties include Talbot, Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester, Somerset, Caroline, and Queen Anne’s. A maximum density requirement of 160 residences or its equivalent per square mile for ground water protection shall apply in these areas for lots where direct ground water penetration is used for sewage disposal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> A person may not dispose of sewage, body, or industrial wastes in any manner which may cause pollution of the ground surface, the waters of the State, or create a nuisance.</p>

A holding tank may not be permitted to serve new construction or for the purpose of adding capacity to an existing disposal system in order to accommodate a change in property use. For a building served by a holding tank, the Approving Authority may not allow a building addition or a change-in-use or operation that would result in a foreseeable or potential increase in sewage flows from the building. A holding tank may be permitted to serve a public building as determined by the Approving Authority and the Department of the Environment to be essential. The permission to allow a holding tank for an essential public service building shall include consideration of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)">(1)</span> Whether the proposed building is directly related to and necessary to protect the public safety;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> A holding tank is required to hold a minimum of 7 days effluent and shall be of watertight construction. The Approving Authority may require a test of water tightness, in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.02.05" title=".05 Design and Construction of Conventional On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems.">Regulation .05(F) of this chapter</a>.

The applicant shall submit, along with the application, a maintenance contract which is acceptable to the Approving Authority and which includes an acceptable pumping schedule by an approved liquid waste hauler. The Approving Authority may issue a holding tank permit if it determines that the issuance of the permit complies with the requirements of this section and does not compromise the public health, a maintenance contract requires safe and adequate disposal of sewage generated, and a holding tank agreement and easement is recorded in the land records for the property.</p>
