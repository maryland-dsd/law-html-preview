However, if the procurement officer determines that the facts justify such action, the procurement officer may receive and act upon any such termination claim at any time after the one-year period or any extension thereof. Upon failure of the Contractor to submit the Contractor's termination claim within the time allowed, the procurement officer may determine the claim at any time after the one-year period or any extension thereof. Upon failure of the Contractor to submit the Contractor's termination claim within the time allowed, the procurement officer may determine, on the basis of information available to the procurement officer, the amount, if any, due to the Contractor by reason of the termination and shall thereupon pay to the Contractor the amount so determined.</p>

In any case where the procurement officer has made a determination of the amount due under paragraph (3), (5), or (9) hereof, the State shall pay to the Contractor the following:(a) if there is no right of appeal hereunder or if no timely appeal has been taken, the amount so determined by the procurement officer, or (b) if an appeal has been taken, the amount finally determined on such appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause there shall be deducted(a) all unliquidated advance or other payments on account theretofore made to the Contractor, applicable to the terminated portion of this contract, (b) any claim which the State may have against the Contractor in connection with this contract, and (c) the agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of, any materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold, pursuant to the provisions of this clause, and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> If the termination hereunder be partial, the Contractor may file with the procurement officer a claim for an equitable adjustment of the price or prices specified in the contract relating to the continued portion of the contract (the portion not terminated by the Notice of Termination), and such equitable adjustment as may be agreed upon shall be made in such price or prices. Any claim by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be asserted within ninety (90) days from the effective date of the termination notice, unless an extension is granted in writing by the procurement officer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The State may from time to time, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the terminated portion of this contract whenever in the opinion of the procurement officer the aggregate of such payments shall be within the amount to which the Contractor shall be entitled hereunder. If the total of such payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, such excess shall be payable by the Contractor to the State upon demand, together with interest computed at the prime rate established by the State Treasurer for the period from the date such excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date on which such excess is repaid to the State; provided, however, that no interest shall be charged with respect to any such excess payment attributable to a reduction in the Contractor's claim by reason of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until ten days after the date of such retention or disposition, or a later date as determined by the procurement officer by reason of the circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> Unless otherwise provided for in this contract, or by applicable statute, the Contractor shall-from the effective date of termination until the expiration of three years after final settlement under this contract-preserve and make available to the State at all reasonable times at the office of the Contractor but without direct charge to the State, all the Contractor's books, records, documents and other evidence bearing on the costs and expenses of the Contractor under this contract and relating to the work terminated hereunder, or, to the extent approved by the procurement officer, reproductions thereof."</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> In recommending the exclusion of a termination for convenience clause in a real property lease, the Secretary shall consider such factors as:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> The practicality of including the termination for convenience clause in a lease of real property located in another state or overseas when the demand for property of a particular type or in some particular geographic location is extremely intense, or when the contents of a lease are established by a foreign government and are effectively non-negotiable, or both;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> The perception of some landlords that the termination for convenience clause permits the State to unilaterally convert a fixed term lease to a day-to-day lease; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> The prospects that some lending institutions may reject loan requests from landlords owning property that the State might wish to lease but that must be first upgraded at the owner's expense to meet State User Agency Requirements.</p>
