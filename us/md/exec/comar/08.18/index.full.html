                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#A">A.</span> The provisions of this regulation apply to boating on any white water portion of stream segments designated in this regulation, but do not apply to stream segments not designated in this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#B">B.</span> For purposes of this regulation, "white water portion" means any portion of a designated stream segment which has any of the criteria characteristics described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C" title="">§C of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C">C.</span> The Department of Natural Resources shall designate white water stream segments in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C(1)">(1)</span> Class III (Intermediate). Rapids with moderate irregular waves occur, which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe. Complex maneuvers in fast current, and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required. Large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided. Strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found, particularly on large volume rivers. Scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are rare. Self-rescue is usually easy, but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C(2)">(2)</span> Class IV (Advanced). Intense, powerful but predictable rapids occur, requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water. Depending on the character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure. A fast, reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or rest. Rapids may require moves above dangerous hazards. Scouting is necessary the first time down. Risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance for rescue is often essential, but requires practiced skills. A strong Eskimo roll is highly recommended.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C(3)">(3)</span> Class V (Expert). Extremely long, obstructed, or very violent rapids occur, which expose a paddler to above average endangerment. Drops may contain large, unavoidable waves and holes or steep, congested chutes with complex, demanding routes. Rapids may continue for long distances between pools, demanding a high level of fitness. What eddies exist may be small, turbulent, or difficult to reach. At the high end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. Scouting is mandatory but often difficult. Swims are dangerous, and rescue is difficult even for experts. A very reliable Eskimo roll, proper equipment, extensive experience, and practiced rescue skills are essential for survival.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/08.18.01.08#C(4)">(4)</span> Class VI (Extreme). One grade more difficult than Class V. These runs often exemplify the extremes of difficulty, unpredictability, and danger. The consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only at favorable water levels, after close personal inspection and taking all precautions. This class does not represent drops thought to be unrunnable, but may include rapids which are only occasionally run.</p>

The states have been granted concurrent enforcement authority on the project, as to the land and the water areas. The states have agreed to enforce essentially identical boating regulations and to share enforcement responsibilities. A fundamental consideration is preserving an acceptable quality of recreational experience on the Lake while providing for the greatest use consistent with a quality experience and safety for all users.</p>
