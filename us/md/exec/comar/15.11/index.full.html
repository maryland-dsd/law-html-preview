                <p>The purpose of this chapter is to explain State animal health requirements for sheep and goats entering or moving within Maryland to prevent the introduction or spread of scrapie, a fatal, degenerative disease. The control and prevention of this disease is a joint effort by the Maryland Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The requirements of this chapter qualify Maryland to be classified as a scrapie consistent state under 9 CFR, Part 79. Scrapie consistent status not only enhances the well-being of the State’s sheep and goat industry by protecting against scrapie but also helps ensure the most favorable treatment possible for Maryland sheep and goat producers in any market. Sheep and goat producers electing to participate in the U.S. Scrapie Flock Certification Program shall follow the requirements for certification found in 9 CFR, Part 54 and 79.</p>
