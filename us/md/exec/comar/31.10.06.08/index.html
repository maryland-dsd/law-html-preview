                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> The following standards are applicable to all Medicare supplement policies or certificates delivered or issued for delivery in this State on or after July 14, 1992, and with an effective date for coverage before June 1, 2010.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> A policy or certificate may not be advertised, solicited, delivered, or issued for delivery in this State as a Medicare supplement policy or certificate unless it complies with these benefit standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Required Standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> The standards in this section apply to Medicare supplement policies and certificates and are in addition to all other requirements of these regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than 6 months from the effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The policy or certificate may not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within 6 months before the effective date of coverage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts. Premiums may be modified to correspond with these changes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate may not provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> Each Medicare supplement policy shall be guaranteed renewable. The issuer may not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(a)">(a)</span> Cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(b)">(b)</span> Cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> If the Medicare supplement policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(9)" title="">§B(9) of this regulation</a>, the issuer shall offer certificate holders an individual Medicare supplement policy which at the option of the certificate holder provides for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(a)">(a)</span> Continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(b)">(b)</span> Benefits which meet the requirements of these regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> If an individual is a certificate holder in a group Medicare supplement policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(a)">(a)</span> Offer the certificate holder the conversion option described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(7)" title="">§B(7) of this regulation</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(b)">(b)</span> At the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificate holder continuation of coverage under the group policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by another group Medicare supplement policy purchased by the same policyholder, the succeeding issuer shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on the group policy's date of termination. Coverage under the new policy may not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)">(10)</span> If a Medicare supplement policy eliminates an outpatient prescription drug benefit as a result of requirements imposed by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the modified policy shall be deemed to satisfy the guaranteed renewal requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(6)" title="">§B(6) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)">(11)</span> Extension of Benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(a)">(a)</span> Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss that commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in force may be conditioned upon the continuous total disability of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(b)">(b)</span> Receipt of Medicare Part D benefits may not be considered in determining a continuous loss under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(11)(a)" title="">§B(11)(a) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)">(12)</span> Suspension of Benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(a)">(a)</span> A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder or certificate holder for a period not to exceed 24 months in which the policyholder or certificate holder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid), but only if the policyholder or certificate holder notifies the issuer of the policy or certificate within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to medical assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(b)">(b)</span> If the suspension described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(12)(a)" title="">§B(12)(a) of this regulation</a> occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to Medicaid, the policy or certificate shall be automatically reinstituted, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement, if the policyholder or certificate holder provides notice of loss of entitlement within 90 days after the date of loss of entitlement and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(c)">(c)</span> A Medicare supplement policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended, for any period that may be provided by federal regulation, at the request of the policyholder, if the policyholder is:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Entitled to benefits under §226(b) of the Social Security Act; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(c)(ii)">(ii)</span> Covered under a group health plan as defined in §1862(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Social Security Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(d)">(d)</span> If the suspension described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.08#B(12)(c)" title="">§B(12)(c) of this regulation</a> occurs and if the policyholder or the certificate holder loses coverage under the group health plan, the Medicare supplement policy shall be reinstituted automatically, effective as of the date of the loss of coverage under the group health plan, if the policyholder described in §B(12)(c):</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(d)(i)">(i)</span> Provides notice of loss of coverage within 90 days after the date of the loss of group coverage; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> Pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of enrollment in the group health plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(e)">(e)</span> Reinstitution of coverage under §B(12)(b) or (d) of this regulation:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(e)(ii)">(ii)</span> Shall provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of suspension;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(e)(iii)">(iii)</span> If the suspended Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, shall provide for the reinstitution of the policy for Medicare Part D enrollees without coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and shall otherwise provide substantially equivalent coverage to the coverage in effect before the date of suspension; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(12)(e)(iv)">(iv)</span> Shall provide for classification of premiums on terms at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the coverage not been suspended.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)">(13)</span> Exchange Offer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)(a)">(a)</span> If an issuer makes a written offer to each Medicare supplement policyholder or certificate holder of one or more of its plans, to exchange during a specified period the individual's 1990 standardized benefit plan, as described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.09" title=".09 Standard Medicare Supplement Benefit Plans for 1990 Plans.">Regulation .09 of this chapter</a>, for a 2010 standardized benefit plan, as described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.06.28" title=".28 Standard Medicare Supplement Benefit Plans for 2010 Plans.">Regulation .28 of this chapter</a>, the offer and subsequent exchange shall comply with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)(b)">(b)</span> An issuer need not provide justification to the Commissioner if the insured replaces a 1990 standardized benefit plan policy or certificate with an issue age rated 2010 standardized plan policy or certificate at the insured's original issue age and duration. If an insured's policy or certificate to be replaced is priced on an issue age rate schedule at the time of the offer, the rate charged to the insured for the new exchanged policy shall recognize the policy reserve buildup, due to the prefunding inherent in the use of an issue age rate basis, for the benefit of the insured. The rate method proposed to be used by an issuer shall be filed with the Commissioner in accordance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.10.01.02" title=".02 Definition.">COMAR 31.10.01.02</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)(d)">(d)</span> An issuer may not apply a new preexisting condition limitation or a new incontestability period to the new policy for those benefits contained in the exchanged 1990 standardized benefit plan policy or certificate of the insured, but may apply a preexisting condition limitation of not more than 6 months to any added benefits contained in the new 2010 standardized benefit plan policy or certificate not contained in the exchanged policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)(e)">(e)</span> The new policy or certificate shall be offered to each policyholder or certificate holder within a given plan, except where the offer or issue would be in violation of State or federal law.</p>
