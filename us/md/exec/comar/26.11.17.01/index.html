                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> “Actual emissions” means:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit as determined in accordance with this subsection;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> As of a particular date, for any emissions unit which has not begun normal operations on the particular date, the unit's potential to emit on that date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)">(b)</span> Actual emissions shall be calculated using the emissions unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(c)">(c)</span> The Department may assume that source-specific allowable emissions for the emissions unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> “Allowable emissions” means the emissions rate calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source, unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both, and the most stringent of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> Applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR 60 and 61;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> Any applicable Maryland State Implementation Plan (SIP) emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition including those with a future compliance date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> Baseline Actual Emissions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)">(a)</span> “Baseline actual emissions” means the rate of emissions, in tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)">(b)</span> For an existing electric utility steam generating unit, “baseline actual emissions” is determined by the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding the date on which a complete application was submitted. The Department may approve a different period upon a demonstration that it is more representative of normal source operations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(c)">(c)</span> For an existing emissions unit, other than an electric utility steam generating unit, "baseline actual emissions" is determined by the average rate, in tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding the date on which a complete application was submitted. The Department may allow a different 24-month consecutive time period, within the last 10 years, upon a demonstration that it is more representative of normal source operations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(d)">(d)</span> For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of the unit shall equal zero, and, thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(e)">(e)</span> For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calculated, for existing electric utility steam generating units, in accordance with the procedures contained in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.01#B(3)(b)" title="">§B(3)(b) of this regulation</a>, for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.01#B(3)(c)" title="">§B(3)(c) of this regulation</a>, and for a new emissions unit, in accordance with the procedures contained in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.01#B(3)(d)" title="">§B(3)(d) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)">(f)</span> In General.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(i)">(i)</span> The average rate of emissions shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(ii)">(ii)</span> The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any noncompliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emissions limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive 24-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a proposed or promulgated maximum achievable control technology standard under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if credit for the emissions reductions was taken in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(iii)">(iii)</span> When a project involves multiple emissions units or different regulated NSR pollutants, only one consecutive 24-month period shall be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(f)(iv)">(iv)</span> The average rate may not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions and adjusting the amount if required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> “Begin actual construction” means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. These activities include installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operation, this definition refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> Best Available Control Technology.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)">(a)</span> “Best available control technology” means an emissions limitation, including a visible emissions standard, based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for that source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combination techniques for control of the pollutant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(b)">(b)</span> Application of best available control technology may not result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by an applicable standard under 40 CFR 60 and 61.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(c)">(c)</span> If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination of these, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of best available control technology. This standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of the design, equipment, work practice, or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> Building, Structure, Facility, or Installation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(a)">(a)</span> “Building, structure, facility, or installation” means all of the pollutant-emitting activities that belong to the same industrial group that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person, or persons under common control.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(b)">(b)</span> Pollutant-emitting activities are considered as part of the same industrial group if they belong to the same “Major Group” (that is, have the same two-digit code as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC) prepared by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and amended in 1987).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> “Commence”, as applied to construction of a major stationary source or major modification, means that the owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(a)">(a)</span> Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-site construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)(b)">(b)</span> Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual on-site construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> “Construction” means any physical change or change in the method of operation, including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or modification of an emissions unit, which would result in a change in emissions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> “Electric utility steam generating unit” means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than 1/3 of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 megawatts electric output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing steam to a steam electric generator that would produce electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)">(10)</span> Emissions Reduction Credit (ERC).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(a)">(a)</span> “Emissions reduction credit (ERC)” means a permanent, enforceable, quantifiable reduction in actual emissions, occurring on or after January 1, 2003, which is surplus to all applicable State and federally enforceable requirements to be used to offset emission increases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(b)">(b)</span> “Emissions reduction credit (ERC)” does not constitute a security or other form of property.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(13)">(13)</span> “Federally enforceable” means all limitations and conditions which are enforceable by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including those requirements developed pursuant to 40 CFR 60 and 61, requirements within the SIP, any permit requirements established pursuant to 40 CFR §52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I, including operating permits issued under a program that is approved by EPA or that is incorporated into the Maryland SIP and expressly requires adherence to any permit issued under the program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(14)">(14)</span> “Fugitive emissions” means those emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(15)">(15)</span> Lowest Achievable Emission Rate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(15)(a)">(a)</span> “Lowest achievable emission rate” means, for any emissions unit, the more stringent rate of emissions based on the following:</p>
