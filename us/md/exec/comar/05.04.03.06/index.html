                <p>All loans shall be made for the terms, and conform to the requirements, set forth below:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Interest Rate. The Department shall from time to time and, in accordance with the Act, establish the interest rate to be paid on all loans at a preferred rate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Term. The Department shall establish the term of all loans which:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> May include a construction period of generally not more than 4 months; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> May not exceed 10 years from completion of construction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Loan Amount Restrictions. Restrictions on loan amounts are as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> The minimum approvable loan amount shall be not less than $2,000;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the maximum amount of loans for improvements to any one migratory labor camp may not exceed $75,000;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> The preceding loan amount restrictions may be varied if, in the sole determination of the Department, the improvements required pursuant to the plan cannot reasonably be financed with the loan amount restrictions;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> If the plan is a multi-phased plan with respect to improvements to the migratory labor camp, and the owner applies to the Program for more than one loan, the preceding loan amount restrictions shall be applied separately to each loan; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, the total maximum amount of loans to any one borrower, or for improvements to any one migratory labor camp, may not exceed $200,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Loan-to-Value Ratio. Notwithstanding the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/05.04.03.06#C" title="">§C of this regulation</a>, a loan may not exceed an amount which, when added to any outstanding debts secured by or relating to the eligible migratory labor camp property, would equal 67 percent of the appraised value of the property after the proposed improvements are completed. If the total amount of outstanding debt relating to the property exceeds 67 percent of the appraised value, the borrower may pledge other assets of the borrower to satisfy the loan-to-value ratio. If other assets are pledged to secure the loan, any outstanding debts secured by or relating to the pledged assets shall be considered in determining the loan-to-value ratio.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Monthly Payment. The borrower shall repay the loan by single monthly payments which shall be applied to expenses, when applicable, interest, and principal, in that order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Late Charge. Late charges, as permitted by law, will be charged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Security for Loans. All loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note and any other documents that the Department may require. All loans shall be secured by a first lien, or in the discretion of the Department a second lien, mortgage, or deed of trust in a form required by the Department, which shall be recorded in the land records of the political subdivision in which the migratory labor camp property is located. Pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/05.04.03.06#D" title="">§D of this regulation</a>, the Department may require the borrower to provide additional security through an indemnity mortgage or a lien covering other assets of the borrower.

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> Assumption. Loans may not be assumed without the prior written consent of the Department. However, an assumption may not be approved unless the proposed borrower qualifies as an eligible applicant in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/05.04.03.04" title=".04 Eligible Borrowers.">Regulation .04 of this chapter</a>.</p>

Before initiation of construction of the improvements, the borrower shall secure all necessary flood plain permits from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the political subdivision in which the migratory labor camp is located.</p>
