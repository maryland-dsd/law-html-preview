An application for each site may be submitted at different times or applications may be submitted simultaneously, at the option of the applicant. A permit to construct that is issued for a site expires if the portable emissions unit has not been located at the site for 3 years, as provided in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.02.04#E" title="">Regulation .04E of this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(2)">(2)</span> Simultaneously with submitting an application for a permit to construct a portable emissions unit at the first site on which the unit is to be located, the applicant may submit an application for a State permit to operate the unit at that site. If the Department issues the permit to construct the portable emissions unit, the Department may simultaneously issue a temporary start-up permit to operate the unit at the same site. The temporary start-up permit may be issued or extended by the Department so that it is effective for up to 1 year from each date that operation commences of the portable emissions unit, as provided at <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.02.04#D" title="">Regulation .04D of this chapter</a>. When it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department that the unit is capable of complying continuously with all applicable requirements, the Department shall issue an operating permit for the unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(3)">(3)</span> At any time a temporary start-up permit or a State permit to operate has been issued for a portable emissions unit at the first site on which the unit is located, the owner or operator may apply for and the Department may issue a State permit to operate the unit at any other site for which a permit to construct has been issued for the unit.</p>
