There is so much work to perform that HVAC contracts with two other companies, Air Supply, Inc. (Air Supply) and Kool and the Gang, Inc. (Kool), to assist with the work. Air Supply and Kool each have their own employees. HVAC retains some supervisory control over the employees of the other companies to make sure that the job is being done to the specifications of the overall mechanical contract. Air Supply and Kool exercise supervision over the installation methods of their respective workforces. Even though the two subcontractors are in the same business as HVAC and they perform the same type of work at the same location as HVAC, there is no employer-employee relationship between the contracting companies, and there is no employee-employer relationship between the subcontractors' employees and HVAC.</p>

Sarah Green inspects the work and requires them to repaint any unsatisfactory work. The painters cannot engage helpers without her consent. She can discharge them for any reason, and they are free to resign at any time. The painters assume no business risks and have no capital investment. None of them has an established business. The painters are employees of Sarah Green, not XYZ, and Sarah Green is an independent contractor, not an employee of XYZ.</p>

A company representative makes frequent inspections of the construction site. When a house is finished, Wallace Black is paid a certain percentage of its costs. He is not responsible for faults, defects of construction, or wasteful operation. At the end of each week, he presents the company with a statement of the amount he has spent, including the payroll. Sawdust gives him a check for that amount from which he pays the assistants, two of whom are day laborers although he is not personally liable for their wages. Wallace Black and all of his assistants are employees of Sawdust.</p>

(Pristine), the general contractor responsible for painting 20 individual cottages. Prior to entering the contract, Pristine seeks and obtains proof from Trisha Gold of payroll withholdings, payment of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation with respect to Trisha Gold's employees. Pristine also provides Trisha Gold with a written notice of her status as an independent contractor and the rights and obligations pursuant to that status.

However, Trisha Gold and Painters each provide their own ladders and brushes. Painters work under Trisha Gold's direction and control and she sets the work hours for the job. Trisha Gold inspects Painters' work to ensure satisfactory performance and she is responsible for paying for any repairs for inadequate work. Trisha Gold is an independent contractor of Pristine.

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> ABC Company (ABC) hires three crews of workers to do the siding on new houses in a residential development. ABC pays each of the crews per square foot of siding installed. ABC tells each crew leader that they are independent contractors responsible for their own workers' compensation premiums and any taxes. None of the crew leaders appears to have their own business, and they fail to get any workers' compensation coverage. One of the crew leaders is designated as general foreman and has been given total responsibility for running the job, but ABC has a superintendent who periodically walks the site to make sure the work is done properly. ABC also provides safety equipment for each worker. At the end of each week, ABC pays the crew leaders a lump sum based on the square footage of siding installed. The crew leader then pays each worker based on how much siding they installed. The workers doing the siding are employees of ABC.</p>
