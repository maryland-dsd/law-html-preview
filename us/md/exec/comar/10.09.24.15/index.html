                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(4)(b)">(b)</span> The rights of any other individual eligible under the plan, for whom he can legally make an assignment.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(7)(c)">(c)</span> If at least one of the following circumstances exists, and the Department, through the local department of social services, believes that because of the existence of that circumstance, in the particular case, proceeding to establish paternity or secure support would be detrimental to the child for whom support would be sought, the Department, through the local department of social services, shall find that cooperation is against the best interests of the child:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(7)(c)(i)">(i)</span> The child for whom support is sought was conceived as a result of incest or forcible rape;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(7)(e)">(e)</span> With respect to obtaining medical care support and payments for an individual in any case not covered by §G(7)(b) or (c) of this regulation, the Department, through the local department of social services, shall find that cooperation is against the best interests of the individual or other person to whom Medical Assistance is being furnished, if it is reasonably anticipated that cooperation will result in reprisal against, and cause physical or emotional harm to, the individual or other person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)">(8)</span> The Department or its designee shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)(a)">(a)</span> Deny or terminate eligibility for any applicant or recipient who refuses to cooperate as required under §G(6) of this regulation unless cooperation has been waived;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)(b)">(b)</span> Provide Medical Assistance to any individual who:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Cannot legally assign his own rights, and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Would otherwise be legally eligible for Medical Assistance but for the refusal by a person legally able to assign his rights or to cooperate as required by this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(9)">(9)</span> The assignment created by this regulation shall be effective as long as the recipient is eligible for Medical Assistance and remains effective for all services paid by the Program during this period of eligibility, and for those services which were erroneously provided to ineligible persons and paid for by the Program.</p>
