However, if the request for proposals so notifies all offerors, discussions need not be conducted:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)(a)">(a)</span> With respect to prices that are fixed by law or regulation, except that consideration shall be given to competitive terms and conditions;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)(c)">(c)</span> If it can be demonstrated clearly from the existence of adequate competition or accurate prior cost experience with the particular item, that acceptance of an initial offer without negotiation would result in a fair and reasonable price;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> The mandatory solicitation requirements set forth in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/21.05.08" title="Chapter 08 Mandatory Written Solicitation Requirements">COMAR 21.05.08</a>;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Distribution. Solicitations or notices of the availability of solicitations shall be mailed or otherwise furnished to a sufficient number of vendors for the purpose of securing competition. Notices of availability shall indicate where, when, and for how long solicitations may be obtained, generally describe the service, supply, or commodity desired, and may contain other appropriate information.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> Publication. Notice of solicitations for which the proposal is reasonably expected to exceed $50,000 shall be published in eMaryland Marketplace unless the resulting master contractor agreement is reasonably expected to be performed entirely outside this State or the District of Columbia. Publication shall be at least 20 days before the proposal submission date. Publication of notice less than 20 days before proposal submission is defective unless notice of the project is not required by State law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Proposal preparation time is the period of time between the date of publication of the solicitation and the time and date set for receipt of proposals. The proposal preparation time shall be a minimum of 20 days.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Pre-proposal conferences may be conducted by the procurement officer or designee to explain the procurement requirements.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> Any pre-proposal conference should be held long enough after the solicitation has been issued to allow prospective offerors to become familiar with it, but sufficiently before proposal opening to allow consideration of the pre-proposal conference results in the preparation of proposals.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)">(4)</span> Attendance at a pre-proposal conference may be encouraged, but may not be made mandatory except to the extent required under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/21.11.03.09#C(2)(e)" title="">COMAR 21.11.03.09C(2)(e)</a>.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> Pre-Proposal Conference Records.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)">(a)</span> When a pre-proposal conference is held in connection with a procurement that is expected to exceed $100,000, the procurement officer shall ensure that a written record of the conference is prepared as soon as practicable and that the record is sent to all prospective offerors who were sent a solicitation or who are known by the procurement officer to have obtained the solicitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(b)">(b)</span> When a pre-proposal conference is held and a conference summary is made, the procurement officer shall ensure that the summary is sent to all prospective offerors who were sent a solicitation or who are known by the procurement officer to have obtained the solicitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(c)">(c)</span> The record or summary of a pre-proposal conference is a public record that is open to public inspection during ordinary business hours.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(d)">(d)</span> Electronic records and transmissions of a pre-bid conference satisfy the requirements of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)">(6)</span> Electronic Pre-Proposal Conferences.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)(a)">(a)</span> Electronic pre-proposal conferences may be conducted if specifically permitted or required in the solicitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)(b)">(b)</span> An electronic pre-proposal conference shall permit interactive communication between all prospective offerors and the procurement officer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)(c)">(c)</span> If pre-proposal conferences are conducted by electronic means, prospective offerors shall be notified of the:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Date and time set for the electronic pre-proposal conference; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)(c)(ii)">(ii)</span> Manner and duration of the interactive session.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Amendments to Solicitations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Form. Each amendment to a solicitation shall be identified as such and shall require that the offeror acknowledge its receipt. The amendment shall reference the portion of the solicitation it amends. The procurement officer shall authorize the issuance of an amendment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Distribution. Amendments shall be sent to all prospective offerors who were sent a solicitation or who are known to the procurement officer to have obtained the solicitation documents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> Timeliness. Amendments shall be distributed within a reasonable time to allow prospective offerors to consider them in preparing their proposals. If the time and date for receipt of proposals does not permit preparation, the time shall be increased to the extent possible in the amendment or, if necessary, by electronic communication or telephone and confirmed in the amendment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Late Proposals, Withdrawals, and Modifications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Policy. Any proposal received at the place designated in the solicitation after the time and date set for receipt of proposal is late. Any request for withdrawal or request for modification received at the place designated in the solicitation after the time and date set for receipt of proposals is late.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> Treatment. A late proposal, late request for modification, or late request for withdrawal may not be considered. Upon the written approval of the Office of the Attorney General, exceptions may be made when a late proposal, withdrawal, or modification is received before master contractor agreement award, and the proposal, modification, or withdrawal would have been timely but for the action or inaction of State personnel directing the procurement activity or their employees. A late modification of a successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the State shall be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted upon the written approval of the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> Records. A record shall be made of each request for late proposal acceptance, modification, or withdrawal which shall be retained in the appropriate procurement file.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Receipt of Proposals.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> Proposals and modifications shall be held in a secure place until the established due date. Proposals may not be opened publicly but shall be opened in the presence of at least two State employees. After the established due date, a register of proposals shall be prepared that identifies each offeror.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> The identity of an offeror and the register of proposals may not be disclosed before the procurement officer makes a determination recommending the award of the master contractor agreement pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/21.05.13.04#B" title="">Regulation .04B of this chapter</a>.
