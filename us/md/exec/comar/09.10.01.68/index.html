                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The twin double is a part of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. It is a contract by each participant to pick (select) the winner of each of four races as may be designated by a licensee, with the approval of the Commission. For the purpose of this rule, these four races will be referred to as the twin double races. The first two races shall be referred to as the first half of the twin double. The third and fourth races shall be referred to as the second half of the twin double. All sums deposited in the twin double shall be held in a single pool entirely separate from all other pools, and the award or dividend to each winning participant shall be calculated, subject to the provisions of this rule, as in a straight pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> All twin double tickets shall be sold at twin double windows and shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from the daily double and other tickets sold.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> The sale of twin double tickets may not commence until after the completion of the second race of the day, unless special permission is obtained from a representative of the Commission. The twin double windows shall close and the machines shall be locked 5 minutes before the official post time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Each participant in the twin double shall designate his selections for the winners of the first half of the twin double races at the time he purchases his twin double ticket and each twin double ticket shall show the selection made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> After the completion of the first half of the twin double races, each participant holding a ticket combining the winners of these two races shall, during the period while the twin double windows are open for this purpose, exchange the ticket for a twin double exchange ticket showing his selections for the winners of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> A twin double exchange ticket may not be issued except upon surrender of a twin double ticket showing the winners of the first half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Twin double windows shall be open for the issue only of twin double exchange tickets after the races comprising the first half have been completed and declared official. The windows shall close at official post time of the start of the second half of the races comprising the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> After the running of the 3rd race of the twin double, the twin double possible payoffs will be posted.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> Inasmuch as the purpose of the twin double is to select the winner of the first half and second half of the twin double races, a participant who selects a starter which runs in but does not win a race is no longer eligible, unless no other participant has selected the winner of that race.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> If a horse is scratched in the first race of the first half of the twin double, all tickets on the scratched horse will be refunded and the money refunded will be deducted from the gross pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> If a horse is scratched in the second race of the first half of the twin double, after the running of the first race of the first half, all twin double tickets combining the scratched horse with the actual winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double shall be paid a price equivalent to that fraction of the net pool derived by dividing the net pool by the total purchase price of all tickets combining the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double with all horses in the second race of the first half of the twin double. The total pay-off of all tickets combining the winner of the first race of the first half of the twin double with the scratched horse in the second race of the first half of the twin double as determined by the method set forth in this rule shall be deducted from the net twin double pool.</p>

The total pay-off of all tickets combining the winners of the first half of the twin double with the scratched horse in the first race of the second half of the twin double as determined by the method set forth in this rule shall be deducted from the net twin double pool.</p>

The total pay-off of all tickets combining the winners of the first half of the twin double and the winner of the first race in the second half of the twin double with the scratched horse in the second race of the second half of the twin double as determined by the method set forth in this rule, shall be deducted from the net twin double pool.</p>

If no exchange ticket combines the winners of the first and second races of the second half of the twin double then the entire pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to all holders of tickets including the first race of the second half winner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Q">Q.</span> In the event of a dead heat in the first race of the first half of the twin double, all tickets combining both winners of the first race of the first half with the winner of the second race of the first half of the twin double shall be eligible for exchange this also applies in the event of a dead heat in the second race of the first half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="R">R.</span> If there is a dead heat in the first race of the second half of the twin double and if there is no ticket combining either winner with the winner of the second race of the second half of the twin double, then the pay-off shall be distributed to holders of tickets on the first race of the second half winners in the same manner in which a place pool is calculated; this also applies in the event of a dead heat in the second race of the second half of the twin double.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="S">S.</span> If the first race of the first half of the twin double is cancelled or declared "no race," full and complete refund shall be made of the twin double pool.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="U">U.</span> If the first race of the second half of the twin double is cancelled the net twin double pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to holders of twin double exchange tickets and holders of winning twin double tickets not surrendered for twin double exchange tickets.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="V">V.</span> If the second race of the second half of the twin double is cancelled the net twin double pool shall be distributed as a straight pool to holders of twin double exchange tickets designating the winner of the first race of the second half of the twin double.</p>
