                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> A licensee may not undertake any engagement for the performance of professional services which the licensee cannot reasonably expect to complete with due professional competence, including compliance, where applicable, with Â§G(2)â(4) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> A licensee may not permit the licensee's name to be associated with financial statements in such a manner as to imply that the licensee is acting as an independent certified public accountant with respect to these financial statements unless the licensee has complied with applicable generally accepted auditing standards, as such standards may be amended, modified, issued, or reissued. Statements on auditing standards issued, reissued, amended, or modified, from time to time, by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and other pronouncements having similar generally recognized authority, are considered to be interpretations of generally accepted auditing standards, and departures therefrom shall be justified by those who do not follow them.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> A licensee may not issue a report asserting that financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted at that time accounting principles if these financial statements contain any departure from those accounting principles which have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole, unless the licensee can demonstrate that by reason of unusual circumstances the financial statements would otherwise have been misleading. In this case, the licensee's report shall describe the departure, the approximate effects thereof, if practicable, and the reasons why compliance with the principle would result in a misleading statement. For purposes of this regulation, generally accepted accounting principles are considered to be defined by pronouncements issued, reissued, amended, or modified, from time to time, by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor and successor entities and similar pronouncements issued by other entities having similar generally recognized authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> A licensee in the performance of accounting and review services or management advisory services, consulting, financial planning, or tax services shall conform to the professional standards applicable to these services at the time the services are performed.</p>

This regulation does not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(a)">(a)</span> Relieve a licensee of any obligations under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/09.24.01.06#G" title="">Â§G of this regulation</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(b)">(b)</span> Affect in any way a licensee's obligation to comply with a validly issued subpoena or summons in a criminal or bankruptcy case;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> Members and agents of the Board and professional practice reviewers may not disclose any client information which comes to their attention from licensees in disciplinary proceedings or otherwise in carrying out their responsibilities, except that they may furnish this information to an investigative or disciplinary body of the kind referred to above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(3)">(3)</span> A licensee shall furnish to the licensee's client or former client, upon request and reasonable notice made within a reasonable time after original issuance of the document in question:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> Other Responsibilities and Practices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(1)">(1)</span> A licensee may not commit any act that reflects adversely on the licensee's fitness to engage in the practice of public accountancy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(2)">(2)</span> A licensee may not permit others to carry out on the licensee's behalf, either with or without compensation, acts which, if carried out by the licensee, would place the licensee in violation of the Code of Professional Conduct.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(3)">(3)</span> A licensee may practice public accountancy only in a proprietorship, a partnership, or a professional corporation, organized in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/Statute_Web/gbo/gbo.pdf" title="">Business Occupations and Professions Article, Title 2, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>.</p>
