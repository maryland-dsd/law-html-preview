                <p>Agency Note: Due to the limited federal standards for governing lighting requirements on low speed vehicles, lighting installed by manufacturers of low speed vehicles may conflict with the standardized lighting listed in SAE Lighting Identification Code J759 and lighting requirements under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 49 CFR §571.108 for vehicles other than low speed vehicles. Lighting devices installed or supplied by the vehicle manufacturer will be considered in compliance under this chapter, provided the lighting device meets the color, mounting location (excluding height requirements), candle power for headlamps when applicable, and functions as designed by the vehicle manufacturer and as required under these regulations. Any additional lighting device required to be installed to meet these regulations, or is otherwise permitted, shall be in compliance with standardized lighting listed in SAE Lighting Identification Code J759 and requirements established under 49 CFR §571.108 pertaining to passenger cars or other appropriate applications, and comply with lighting requirements established under this chapter.

If a low speed vehicle is equipped with high and low beam headlamps, both lamps are required to function. A low beam headlamp shall have a minimum of 3,500 candlepower and a high beam headlamp a minimum of 5,000 candlepower. Headlamps that incorporate both high and low beam in the same assembly will be aligned on low beam. Headlamp inspection and aiming by computer image processing method requires a level area sufficient for the vehicle and test equipment. The test equipment shall be accurately calibrated to the floor and accurately aligned to the vehicle.</p>
                <p>Agency Note: Manufacturers of low speed vehicles may equip their vehicles with lamps which are not identified as approved headlamps by federal motor vehicle safety standards established for vehicles other than low speed vehicles, for example: required marking symbol of "DOT" (Department of Transportation) on headlamp lens, and any additional manufacturer's markings of headlamp type and SAE identification code. Manufacturers of low speed vehicles utilizing lighting in their vehicles as headlamps, which are not properly identified with the appropriate marking, however, are equipped with multibeam road lighting (high and low beam headlamps), will be treated as headlamps and aligned by using the Division's approved headlight testers. Lighting utilized by manufacturers of low speed vehicles as headlamps which are identified as a type lighting other than a headlamp, for example: SAE "Y", auxiliary driving lamp, or by lighting utilized as headlamps which fails to contain the appropriate headlamp marking and is not multibeam road lighting as noted above, will not be inspected and aligned by the use of the Division's approved headlight testers. These lamps will instead be visually inspected and rejected under "Non-Headlamps", inspection procedures listed below.</p>
