                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(6)">(6)</span> For shipments of hazardous waste to a designated facility in an authorized state which has not yet obtained authorization to regulate that particular waste as hazardous, the generator shall assure that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(6)(a)">(a)</span> The owner or operator of the designated facility agrees to sign and return the manifest to the generator; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(6)(b)">(b)</span> Any out-of-State transporter signs and forwards the manifest to the designated facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(7)">(7)</span> For rejected shipments of hazardous waste or container residues contained in non-empty containers that are returned to the generator by the designated facility in accordance with the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.05#C" title="">COMAR 26.13.05.05C</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.06.05#A" title="">COMAR 26.13.06.05A</a>, or analogous regulations effective in the state in which the destination facility is located, the generator shall:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)">(1)</span> Legal Equivalence to Paper Manifests. For the purposes of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.01" title="Chapter 01 Hazardous Waste Management System: General">COMAR 26.13.01</a>—.10:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)(a)">(a)</span> An electronic manifest that is obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.03.04#A(1)(b)" title="">§A(1)(b) of this regulation</a>, and used in accordance with this section instead of using EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A, is the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures and satisfies for all purposes any requirement to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a manifest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)(b)">(b)</span> A requirement to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of §E-2 of this regulation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)(c)">(c)</span> A requirement to give, provide, send, forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by submission to the electronic manifest system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)(d)">(d)</span> A requirement for a generator to keep or retain a copy of a manifest is satisfied by retention of a signed electronic manifest in the generator's account on the national electronic manifest system if the copy is readily available for viewing and production if requested by an inspector representing the Department or EPA; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(1)(e)">(e)</span> If a generator is unable to produce an electronic manifest for inspection in accordance with §E-1(1)(d) of this regulation, the generator is not considered to be in violation of the requirement to have a copy of the manifest readily available if the generator can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the electronic manifest system for which the generator bears no responsibility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(2)">(2)</span> Accessing the Electronic Manifest System. A generator may participate in the electronic manifest system either by accessing the electronic manifest system from the generator's own electronic equipment, or by accessing the electronic manifest system from portable equipment brought to the generator's site by the transporter who accepts the hazardous waste shipment from the generator for off-site transportation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(3)">(3)</span> Restriction on Use of Electronic Manifests.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(3)(a)">(a)</span> Except as provided in §E-1(3)(b) of this regulation, a generator may use an electronic manifest for the tracking of waste shipments involving any hazardous waste only if it is known at the time the manifest is originated that all waste handlers named on the manifest participate in the use of the electronic manifest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(3)(b)">(b)</span> A generator may sign by hand and retain a paper copy of the manifest signed by hand by the initial transporter, instead of executing the generator copy electronically, thereby enabling the transporter and subsequent waste handlers to execute the remainder of the manifest copies electronically.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(4)">(4)</span> Requirement for One Printed Copy. To the extent that the U.S. Department of Transportation hazardous materials regulation on shipping papers for carriage by public highway requires shippers of hazardous materials to supply a paper document for compliance with 49 CFR §177.817, a generator originating an electronic manifest shall also provide the initial transporter with one printed copy of the electronic manifest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(5)">(5)</span> Special Procedures When the Electronic Manifest System Is Unavailable. If a generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a hazardous waste shipment, but the electronic manifest system becomes unavailable for any reason before the time that the initial transporter has signed electronically to acknowledge the receipt of the hazardous waste from the generator, then the generator shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(5)(a)">(a)</span> Obtain and complete a paper manifest and, if necessary, a continuation sheet (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) in accordance with the manifest instructions; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(5)(b)">(b)</span> Use the paper forms identified in §E-1(5)(a) of this regulation from this point forward for the shipment in accordance with the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.03.04#E" title="">§E of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(6)">(6)</span> Special Procedures for Electronic Signature Methods Undergoing Tests. If a generator has prepared an electronic manifest for a hazardous waste shipment, and signs this manifest electronically using an electronic signature method that is undergoing pilot or demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal dependability of the signature method, then the generator shall also sign with an ink signature the certification of the generator or offeror on the printed copy of the manifest provided under §E-1(4) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(7)">(7)</span> Post-Receipt Manifest Data Corrections.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(7)(a)">(a)</span> After facilities have certified to the receipt of hazardous wastes by signing Item 20 of the manifest, any post-receipt data corrections may be submitted at any time by any interested person named on the manifest, such as a waste handler; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E-1(7)(b)">(b)</span> Generators may participate electronically in the post-receipt data corrections process by following the process described in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.05#B(11)" title="">COMAR 26.13.05.05B(11)</a>, which applies to corrections made to either paper or electronic manifest records.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E-2">E-2.</span> Electronic Manifest Signatures. An electronic signature method used in connection with the electronic manifest system is acceptable only if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-2(1)">(1)</span> Use of the method results in the creation of a legally valid and enforceable signature under applicable EPA and other federal requirements pertaining to electronic signatures; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E-2(2)">(2)</span> The method has been designed and implemented in a manner that EPA considers to be as cost-effective and practical as possible for the users of the manifest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Waste Minimization Certification.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> For the purposes of the certification in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.03.04#F(2)" title="">§F(2) of this regulation</a>:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(a)">(a)</span> "Large quantity generator" means a person that generates, in a calendar month:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> 1,000 kilograms or more of hazardous waste; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> 1 kilogram or more of acute hazardous waste; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)">(b)</span> "Small quantity generator" means a person that generates, in a calendar month:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Less than 1 kilogram of acute hazardous waste.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> A generator that initiates a shipment of hazardous waste and that is required to prepare a manifest in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.03.04#A" title="">§A of this regulation</a> shall certify to one of the following statements in Item 15 of the uniform hazardous waste manifest:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)(a)">(a)</span> "I am a large quantity generator. I have a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste generated to the degree I have determined to be economically practicable and I have selected the practicable method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available to me which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment."; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)(b)">(b)</span> "I am a small quantity generator. I have made a good faith effort to minimize my waste generation and select the best waste management method that is available to me and that I can afford."</p>
