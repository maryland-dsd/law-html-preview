The owner or operator shall use a statistical procedure that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="K(4)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="K(4)(c)(ii)">(ii)</span> Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying hazardous constituent presence in the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real presence in the treatment zone.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)">(5)</span> The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under Regulations <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.06" title=".06 Ground Water Protection — General.">.06</a>—<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.06-7" title=".06-7 Corrective Action for Solid Waste Management Units.">.06-7</a> of this chapter if the Secretary finds that the owner or operator satisfied <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.13#K(4)" title="">§K(4) of this regulation</a> and if unsaturated zone monitoring under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.13#I" title="">§I of this regulation</a> indicates that hazardous constituents have not migrated beyond the treatment zone during the active life of the land treatment unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> Special Requirements for Ignitable or Reactive Waste. The owner or operator may not apply ignitable or reactive waste to the treatment zone unless the waste and the treatment zone meet all applicable requirements of 40 CFR Part 268, and the waste is:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)">(1)</span> Immediately incorporated into the soil so that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)(a)">(a)</span> The resulting waste, mixture, or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive waste under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.02.11" title=".11 Characteristic of Ignitability.">COMAR 26.13.02.11</a> or .13, and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(2)">(2)</span> Managed in such a way that it is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or react.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> Special Requirements for Incompatible Wastes. The owner or operator may not place incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials (see Regulation .24, of this chapter, for examples), in or on the same treatment zone, unless Regulation .02H(2) of this regulation is complied with.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Special Requirements for Hazardous Wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)">(1)</span> Hazardous Wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027 may not be placed in a land treatment unit unless the owner or operator operates the facility in accordance with a management plan for these wastes that is approved by the Secretary under the standards set out in this section, and in accord with all other applicable requirements of this chapter. The factors to be considered are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(a)">(a)</span> The volume, physical, and chemical characteristics of the wastes including their potential to migrate through soil or to volatilize or escape into the atmosphere;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(b)">(b)</span> The attenuative properties of underlying and surrounding soils or other materials;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(c)">(c)</span> The mobilizing properties of other materials co-disposed with these wastes; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(d)">(d)</span> The effectiveness of additional treatment, design, or monitoring techniques.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(2)">(2)</span> The Secretary may determine that additional design, operating, and monitoring requirements are necessary for land treatment facilities managing hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027 in order to reduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to ground water, surface water, or air so as to protect human health and the environment.</p>
