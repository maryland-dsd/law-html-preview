                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> Applicability. This regulation applies to owners and operators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as Regulation .01 otherwise provides.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Purpose and Implementation of Contingency Plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Every owner or operator shall have a contingency plan for his facility. The contingency plan shall be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The provisions of the plan shall be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human health or the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Content of Contingency Plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> The contingency plan shall describe the actions facility personnel shall take to comply with §§B and G of this regulation, in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> If the owner or operator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with 40 CFR 112 or 1510, or some other emergency or contingency plan, he need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> The plan shall describe arrangements agreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services, pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.03#H" title="">Regulation .03H of this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> The plan shall list names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see §F), and this list shall be kept up to date. When more than one person is listed, one shall be named as primary emergency coordinator and others shall be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates. For new facilities, this information shall be supplied to the Secretary at the time of certification, rather than at the time of permit application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> The plan shall include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list shall be kept up to date. In addition, the plan shall include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(6)">(6)</span> The plan shall include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan shall describe signals to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (when the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Copies of Contingency Plan. A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Maintained at the facility; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> Submitted to all local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Amendments of Contingency Plan. The contingency plan shall be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever the:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Facility permit is revised;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Plan fails in an emergency;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> Facility changes in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> List of emergency coordinators changes; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(5)">(5)</span> List of emergency equipment changes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Emergency Coordinator. At all times, there shall be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on call (that is, available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator shall be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person shall have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Emergency Procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) shall immediately:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(a)">(a)</span> Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(b)">(b)</span> Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator shall immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> Concurrently, the emergency coordinator shall assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment shall consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (for example, the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, or if the release is of a quantity which would exceed the Reportable Quantities listed in 40 CFR Part 302, the emergency coordinator shall report these findings as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(a)">(a)</span> If the assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator shall immediately notify appropriate local authorities and be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)">(b)</span> The emergency coordinator shall immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area (in the applicable regional contingency plan under 40 CFR Part 1510) or the National Response Center using their 24-hour toll-free number (800) 424-8802, and the Maryland Department of the Environment, Emergency Response Program (866) 633-4686. The report shall include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Name and telephone number of reporter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Name and address of facility;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> Time and type of incident (for example, release, fire);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(iv)">(iv)</span> Name and quantity of materials involved, to the extent known;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(v)">(v)</span> The extent of injuries, if any; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)(b)(vi)">(vi)</span> The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(5)">(5)</span> During an emergency, the emergency coordinator shall take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures shall include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released waste, and removing or isolating containers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(6)">(6)</span> If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator shall monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(7)">(7)</span> Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator shall provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(8)">(8)</span> The emergency coordinator shall ensure that, in the affected areas of the facility:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(8)(a)">(a)</span> Waste that may be incompatible with the released material is not treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(8)(b)">(b)</span> All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(9)">(9)</span> The owner or operator shall notify the Secretary, and appropriate other State and local authorities, that the facility is in compliance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.04#G(8)" title="">§G(8) of this regulation</a> before operations are resumed in the affected areas of the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(10)">(10)</span> The owner or operator shall note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that required implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he shall submit a written report on the incident to the Secretary. The report shall include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(10)(a)">(a)</span> Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;</p>
