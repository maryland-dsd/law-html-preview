Each loan shall be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust, in the form required by the Program, and recorded in the land records of the county in which the home is located. Subordinate liens may not be placed on the home without the prior written consent of the Program. The mortgage or deed of trust securing the loan may be subordinate to not more than one other recorded mortgage lien which:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)">(1)</span> Shall secure a remaining mortgage debt of not more than 25 percent of the equity in the home, equity being determined in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/05.03.05.07#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a>; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)">(1)</span> Hazard Insurance. The borrower shall maintain fire and extended coverage insurance at the owner's expense in an amount not less than the replacement value of the home. The hazard insurance policy shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)(a)">(a)</span> Be written by companies authorized to transact business in Maryland;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)(b)">(b)</span> Be in force at the time of loan closing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)(c)">(c)</span> Name the Department as loss payee as its interest may appear in the standard mortgagee endorsement attached to or printed in the policy; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(1)(d)">(d)</span> Contain terms and coverage satisfactory to the Program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)">(2)</span> Flood Insurance. If the home is in the 100-year flood plain, as designated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(a)">(a)</span> Home shall be covered by a flood plain insurance policy naming the Department as a beneficiary, in an amount equal to the borrower's maximum line of credit, up to the federal limit, plus any other indebtedness secured by the home; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(2)(b)">(b)</span> Flood plain insurance policy may not be terminated without prior notification to the Department.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)">(1)</span> The Program shall establish procedures for requesting equity payments, and shall establish limits for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)(a)">(a)</span> Minimum and maximum dollar amounts for the initial and any succeeding equity payment requests during any fiscal year; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)(b)">(b)</span> The maximum frequency of requests per year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(2)">(2)</span> Equity payments will be made to the borrower only upon borrower's request, which shall be in accordance with Program procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(3)">(3)</span> The borrower is responsible for making payments for real estate taxes, insurance, ground rent, and any other fees or payments relating to the home. The borrower may use loan disbursements to make these payments. If any of these payments become delinquent, the Program, in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so, may make immediate and direct payment of these expenses and increase the outstanding loan balance by the amount of the payment. In making this payment, the Program may override the borrower's maximum line of credit, the Program maximum line of credit, or the maximum in equity payments available to the borrower for that fiscal year. Any direct payment by the Program may not be construed as a waiver of the borrower's obligation, and the borrower's loan still may be declared in default.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)">(4)</span> The borrower may not be entitled to disbursements of equity payments if there are any uncured defaults under the deed of trust or any other loan documents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> Change of Ownership or Occupancy of the Home or of Borrower Eligibility. The Program shall establish policies and procedures to monitor the continued ownership and occupancy of the home and eligibility of the borrower for the loan, including an annual borrower recertification procedure. The Program may at its option terminate the right to any future borrowing against the line of credit or may accelerate the loan if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(1)">(1)</span> The borrower fails to meet the standards for occupancy or use of the loan proceeds;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(2)">(2)</span> An interest in the home has been transferred, except that the borrower may lease a room or portion of the home if the borrower continues to reside in the home and obtains the prior written approval of the Program;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(3)">(3)</span> There is an unpermitted lien or encumbrance on the home; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(4)">(4)</span> The borrower fails to respond to the recertification request within a reasonable time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Taxes, Insurance, and Other Assessments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)">(1)</span> Real estate taxes, ground rent, water and sewer fees, condominium or homeownership fees, insurance coverage required under §K, and other assessments shall be paid when due by the borrower. If the borrower fails to make the payments or to provide the Program with evidence of payment, the Program may at its option take one or more of the following actions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(a)">(a)</span> Make these payments directly as described in §L(3), above;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(b)">(b)</span> Refuse to make further disbursements requested by the borrower; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)(c)">(c)</span> Foreclose on the home.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(2)">(2)</span> Escrow Account. If there is no prior mortgage requiring the payment of expenses to a mortgagee, the Program may establish an escrow account for the borrower at the loan closing and may require the borrower to make monthly expense payments consisting of 1/12 of annual real estate taxes, ground rent, property insurance premiums and, when appropriate, other items for which payments are required by the Program. Instead of an escrow account, the Program may require evidence of payment of the taxes, insurance, and assessments described in §N(1), above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O">O.</span> Maintaining the Home. The borrower shall maintain the home in good repair, and the Program shall have the right to inspect the home. If the Program determines that repairs are necessary, the Program shall have the right but not the obligation to cause the repairs to be made and to charge the cost of the repairs against the borrower's line of credit as an equity payment. In this event, the Program may override the borrower's maximum line of credit, the Program maximum line of credit, or the maximum of equity payments available to the borrower for that fiscal year. These actions by the Program may not be construed as a waiver of borrower's obligation to maintain the home, and the borrower's loan may still be declared in default.</p>
