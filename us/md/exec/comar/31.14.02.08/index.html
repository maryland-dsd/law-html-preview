                <p>The disclosure required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.02.03#J" title="">Regulation .03J of this chapter</a> shall read as follows:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Long-Term Care Insurance</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Personal Worksheet</strong>
                </p>
                <p>People buy long-term care insurance for many reasons. Some don't want to use their own assets to pay for long-term care. Some buy insurance to make sure they can choose the type of care they get. Others don't want their family to have to pay for care or don't want to go on Medicaid. But long-term care insurance may be expensive, and may not be right for everyone.</p>
                <p>By state law, the insurance company must fill out part of the information on this worksheet and ask you to fill out the rest to help you and the company decide if you should buy this policy.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Premium Information</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Policy Form Numbers<strong> ________________________</strong></p>
                <p>The premium for the coverage you are considering will be [$_____ per month, or $_____ per year,] [a one-time single premium of $_____.]</p>
                <p><strong>Type of Policy</strong> (noncancellable/guaranteed renewable):</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The Company's Right to Increase Premiums:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>[The company cannot raise your rates on this policy.] [The company has a right to increase premiums on this policy form in the future, provided it raises rates for all policies in the same class in this state.] [Insurers shall use appropriate bracketed statement. Rate guarantees shall not be shown on this form.]</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Rate Increase History</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The company has sold long-term care insurance since [year] and has sold this policy since [year]. [The company has never raised its rates for any long-term care policy it has sold in this state or any other state.] [The company has not raised its rates for this policy form or similar policy forms in this state or any other state in the last 10 years.] [The company has raised its premium rates on this policy form or similar policy forms in the last 10 years. Following is a summary of the rate increases.]</p>
                <p><strong>Drafting Note:</strong> A company may use the first bracketed sentence above only if it has never increased rates under any prior policy forms in this state or any other state. The issuer shall list each premium increase it has instituted on this or similar policy forms in this state or any other state during the last 10 years. The list shall provide the policy form, the calendar years the form was available for sale, and the calendar year and the amount (percentage) of each increase. The insurer shall provide minimum and maximum percentages if the rate increase is variable by rating characteristics. The insurer may provide, in a fair manner, additional explanatory information as appropriate.</p>
