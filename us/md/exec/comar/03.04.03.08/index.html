                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Corporations operating within and outside the State as unitary businesses shall use an apportionment formula to determine the amount of income to be allocated:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> All of the factors of the apportionment formula shall be developed as fractions, the numerator of which shall be the total of items in this State during the tax year, and the denominator shall be the total of items everywhere during the tax year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> Each factor shall be separately determined and the number of factors used shall be averaged to arrive at the final apportionment factor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> The items on both numerator and denominator of each factor shall be adjusted by the applicable addition and subtraction adjustments provided under Tax-General Article, Title 10, Subtitle 3, Part II, Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>
                <p>Example 1: In computing the net dividend item includible in the denominator of its sales factor, X Company includes the total amount of the dividends that it reported on its federal income tax return. X Company then reduces that amount by its adjustment for dividends for domestic corporations claiming foreign tax credit and by its adjustment for dividends from related foreign corporations. X Company also reduces that amount by the total amount of the special deductions that X Company reported on its federal income tax return.</p>
                <p>Example 2: In computing the net interest item includible in the denominator of its sales factor, Y Company includes the total amount of the interest that it reported on its federal income tax return and reduces that amount by its adjustment for income from U.S. obligations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> The items of both numerator and denominator shall be reconciled to the items as categorized and reported on the federal income tax return.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> If a return is filed by a corporation operating within and outside the State which reflects a loss with no income to be apportioned, an apportionment factor shall be calculated for the filing to be considered complete.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> For a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the apportionment formula is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor, payroll factor, and twice the sales factor, and the denominator is four;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, but before January 1, 2019, the apportionment formula is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor, the payroll factor, and three times the sales factor, and the denominator of which is five;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(c)">(c)</span> For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2018, but before January 1, 2020, the apportionment formula is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor, the payroll factor, and four times the sales factor, and the denominator of which is six;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(d)">(d)</span> For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2019, but before January 1, 2021, the apportionment formula is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor, the payroll factor, and five times the sales factor, and the denominator of which is seven; and</p>

                <p>Example 1: An attorney, a partner in law firm A located in the District of Columbia, renders legal advice to a domiciliary of Maryland. Assuming sufficient nexus between the law firm and Maryland so as to require the filing of a Maryland income tax return, the fee earned from the service rendered to the Maryland domiciliary is included in the numerator of A's sales factor.</p>
                <p>Example 2: An accountant B, whose firm is located within Maryland, performs accounting services for a resident of Pennsylvania. The fee earned from these services is not included in the numerator of B's sales factor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)">(b)</span> Business Enterprises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)(i)">(i)</span> "Business enterprise" includes a proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, corporation, limited liability company, and any other entity, regardless of how structured or denominated, that is engaged in business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> A business enterprise shall be considered a customer within this State if the business enterprise is domiciled in this State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> If the customer is a business enterprise, then the domicile is the state in which is located the office or place of business that provides the principal impetus for the sale. If an office or place of business cannot be identified as providing the principal impetus for the sale, then the domicile shall be the state in which the headquarters or principal place of business management of the customer is located.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2">Example 2-1: X Company, a subsidiary corporation located in Maryland, administers medical plans on behalf of its parent corporation, which is located in Tennessee. X Company administers these medical plans for individuals that are domiciled in Maryland. The fees paid for these administration services are included in the numerator of X Company's sales factor. This example illustrates that the ultimate customer is determined by the domicile of the individual/business enterprise actually receiving the service.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2">Example 3: Service provider C contracts with corporation D, an enterprise operating within and outside the State, to redesign the operating software for D's customer billing operation. The principal impetus for this contract is to provide a benefit to the central billing computers. If those computers are located within Maryland, then the revenue earned from these services is included in the numerator of C's sales factor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2">Example 4: Service provider E contracts with corporation F, an enterprise operating within and outside the State, to redesign all the operating software of Fâs multistate computer network. If no particular office or place of business can be identified as the principal impetus for this contract, then the revenue earned from this contract shall be included in the numerator of E's sales factor only if F's headquarters or principal place of business management is located within Maryland.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> Services Related to Real Property. If a person provides a service relating to construction or improvement to real property, then whether the customer is a customer within this State will be determined by the situs of the property.</p>
                <p>Example 5: An architect contracts with a nonresident of this State to design a shopping center in this State. The architect shall include in the numerator of the sales factor all revenue received from the customer.</p>
                <p>Example 6: A contractor contracts with a resident of Maryland to construct an apartment complex outside of this State. The contractor does not include in the numerator of the sales factor the revenue received from the customer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)">(4)</span> Brokerage Services. Receipts derived from securities brokerages services allocable to this State are determined by multiplying the total dollar amount of sales of securities brokerage services by a fraction, the numerator of which is the receipts from securities brokerage services from customers domiciled in this State and the denominator of which is the receipts from securities brokerage services from all customers. Receipts from securities brokerage services include commissions on transactions, the spread earned on principal transactions in which the broker buys or sells from its account, total margin interest paid on behalf of brokerage accounts owned by the broker's customers, and fees and receipts of all kinds from the underwriting of securities. For principal transactions that are part of brokerage receipts, if the income from these transactions can be tied to, or associated with, an identifiable customer that provides the impetus for the transaction, the receipt shall be assigned to the domicile of that customer. If it is impossible to identify or associate a specific customer with a receipt, the receipt shall be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the receipts factor. If receipts from brokerage services can be associated with a particular customer, but it is impractical to associate the receipts with the address of the customer, the customer shall be presumed to have a domicile at the branch office that generates transactions for the customer.</p>
                <p>Example 7: Broker A executes a transaction on a stock exchange for Customer B, a Maryland domiciliary, selling 100 shares of Corporation X for $1,000 and earning a $50 commission on the transaction. The commission is included in the numerator of A's sales factor.</p>
                <p>Example 8: Broker C executes a transaction for Customer E, a domiciliary of Maryland, whereby C sells to E securities from its own account. Broker C's purchase cost is $1,000 and sales price is $1,025. The spread of $25 is included in the numerator of C's sales factor. This example illustrates two principles. First, only net proceeds, not gross proceeds, from principal transactions in which the broker sells from its own account are included in the sales factor. Second, the net amount is included in the sales factor numerator because Customer E, a domiciliary of Maryland, is the principle impetus for the transaction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> Services to Regulated Investment Companies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)">(a)</span> Receipts from services that are derived directly or indirectly from the sale of management, distribution, administration, or securities brokerages services to, or on behalf of, a regulated investment company or its beneficial owners (including receipts derived directly or indirectly from trustees, sponsors, or participants of employee benefit plans that have accounts in a regulated investment company) shall be allocated to this State to the extent that shareholders of the regulated investment company are domiciled in this State. A separate computation shall be made with respect to the receipts derived from each regulated investment company. The total amount of receipts derived from each regulated investment company which are allocable to this State shall be equal to the total receipts so derived multiplied by a fraction:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The numerator of which is the average of the sum of the beginning-of-the-year and end-of-the-year number of shares owned by the regulated investment company share-holders domiciled in this State; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The denominator of which is the average of the sum of the beginning-of-the-year and end-of-the-year number of shares owned by all shareholders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(b)">(b)</span> For purposes of the fraction, the year shall be the taxable year of the regulated investment company that ends with or within the taxable year of the taxpayer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(c)">(c)</span> "Domicile" means the shareholder's mailing address on the records of the regulated investment company. If the regulated investment company or the person providing management services to the regulated investment company has actual knowledge that the shareholder's primary residence or principal place of business is different than the shareholder's mailing address, then the shareholder's primary residence or principal place of business is the shareholder's domicile. If the shareholder's address is not known or determinable and it is impracticable to obtain this information, then the domicile of the shareholder will be the location or domicile of the business entity that provides the impetus for the transaction.</p>
                <p>Example 9: Mutual Fund X is an investment option in a Â§401(k) plan sponsored by Company Z located and domiciled in Ohio, but the mutual fund does not maintain addresses of the plan participants. The "customer" and associated receipts would be domiciled in Ohio. If the Mutual Fund does maintain addresses of the plan participants, the "customer" and associated receipts would be assigned to Maryland if the address of the plan participant is in Maryland.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)">(6)</span> Broadcast and Print Media. All revenue, including advertising receipts, derived from print and broadcast media shall be included in the numerator of the sales factor based on a reasonable estimate of the Maryland component of the audience for the broadcaster or publisher. In the case of print media, audience shall be measured by circulation.</p>
                <p>Example 10: A radio station in the District of Columbia regularly solicits business in Maryland and broadcasts its signal into Maryland. The station subscribes to a ratings service that enables it to demonstrate to its advertisers the location, size, and demographics of its listening audience. The percentage of the audience that represents the Maryland component of the total audience is applied to total revenue to determine the Maryland sales.</p>
                <p>Example 11: A newspaper is engaged in business in both Maryland and the District of Columbia. The amount of its total revenue to be included in the Maryland sales factor numerator is determined based on the newspaper's circulation. The percentage of total circulation attributable to Maryland is applied to total revenue to determine the Maryland sales.</p>

If a business enterprise provides processing or similar services to a customer having a location in more than one state, then the business enterprise's customers within this State are determined by the point of sale between the ultimate consumer and the business enterprise's customer.</p>
                <p>Example 12: A credit card processing company contracts with a major retailer operating within and outside the State. The processor shall include in the numerator of its sales factor all revenue received from the retailer derived from sales by the retailer in this State.</p>
