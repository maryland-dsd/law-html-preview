                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> If the auditor is unable to express an unqualified opinion on financial statements, a separate letter shall be submitted to the Commission by the college which indicates in detail management's plan to correct the problem so that the auditor can issue an unqualified opinion in the future. These letters shall accompany the financial statements when they are submitted to the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> Management Letter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)(a)">(a)</span> A college shall require the independent certified public accountant to issue a management letter to the college which shall contain a listing of all material weaknesses in the college's system of internal controls.

The independent certified public accountant shall render a report on the scope of the accountant's examination of the Annual Financial Report (form MHEC-CC-4) and express the accountant's opinion as to the fairness of the Summary Statement of Revenues and Expenditures and the enrollment data. Explicit references are required with regard to enrollment data and whether the principles and procedures governing the interrelationship between the current unrestricted general fund and the auxiliary enterprise fund result in a fair presentation of the current unrestricted general fund revenues and expenditures. The independent certified public accountant also shall prepare a reconciliation of any differences in total current general unrestricted revenues and expenditures as shown in the Annual Financial Report (form MHEC-CC-4) and those same revenues and expenditures as reflected in the audited financial statements. For purposes of expressing an opinion on the Annual Financial Report (MHEC-CC-4), the independent certified public accountant shall comply with Â§D(5)â(15) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> Full-time equivalent student enrollment shall be audited with the same diligence as applied to the financial statements, that is, the general standards and standards of field work apply to the enrollment audit.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(8)">(8)</span> Except as provided in COMAR 13B.07.02.03F and G, students shall be classified by their geographic area of residence to ensure that out-of-State students do not enter into the computation of full-time equivalent students for State aid purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(9)">(9)</span> A faculty or staff member, or dependents of the faculty or staff member of the college enrolled without tuition charge, may not be included in the computation of full-time equivalent students for the purposes of State aid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(10)">(10)</span> A college may not enter into a contractual agreement with an organization or institution which offers instruction resulting in credit or equated credit submitted for State aid to the college without the prior approval of the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(11)">(11)</span> A college may not submit for State aid credits awarded to students for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(11)(a)">(a)</span> Satisfactory completion of standardized tests of college-level performance, competency, or aptitude; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(11)(b)">(b)</span> Work experience or life experience which does not require direct college instruction or supervision.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(12)">(12)</span> Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, full-time equivalent enrollment is to be reported to the Commission within the fiscal year in which the courses are taught. Full-time equivalent enrollment in credit or equated credit courses that are conducted over the fiscal year end shall be reported in the fiscal year in which the courses are predominantly taught.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(13)">(13)</span> An auditor shall direct particular attention to sections of the Commission general policies regarding contractual agreements with organizations offering instruction, State or federally funded contracts, and maintenance of effort by local subdivisions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(14)">(14)</span> When local, State, or federally funded contracts or grants, or both, pay for program or course costs, or both, State aid is not paid for that proportion of full-time equivalent students whose total costs are funded by the grant or contract.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(15)">(15)</span> There is a clear distinction between the State's participation in support of current expenses and in support of construction projects, and this distinction shall be maintained in the college's accounts and reports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(16)">(16)</span> Transfer expenditures are included in adjusted current unrestricted operating expenditures only if the nature of the transfer coincides with the definition of an expenditure defined as a current general unrestricted fund expenditure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(17)">(17)</span> Encumbrances outstanding at year end shall be substantiated by written and approved purchase orders or contracts for the future delivery of goods or services not received as of June 30. In the preparation of financial statements, open encumbrances are to be reported under generally accepted accounting principles as a reservation of fund balance, since the commitments will be honored through subsequent year's expenditures. Open encumbrances outstanding at year end do not constitute expenditures or liabilities in the financial statements or in the Annual Financial Report (MHEC-CC-4).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Filing Requirements.</p>
