                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(2)">(2)</span> The maximum State construction allocation for a renovation is calculated by multiplying the estimated costs of construction, including site work, by the State cost share percentage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(3)">(3)</span> At the time of contract award, the actual funding is based on the costs of items eligible for State participation, up to the maximum State construction allocation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)">(4)</span> Adjustments to Maximum State Construction Allocation for a Renovation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)(a)">(a)</span> The IAC may subtract from the maximum State construction allocation funding approved for other projects not older than 15 years old at that school.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)(b)">(b)</span> If projects in the school have been funded within the previous 15 years, the LEA shall provide documentation to identify all previously funded scopes of work that may be replaced or upgraded in the renovation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(5)">(5)</span> For a renovation, the new average year of completed construction of the building or portion of the building is determined by the average year of completed construction of the original building, plus the year of completed construction of the renovation, divided by 2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)">(6)</span> The State may further participate in funding projects in the school within 15 years after the project is placed in service.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> Addition. When a project involves an addition only, the IAC at its discretion may calculate the maximum State construction allocation according to either:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)">(1)</span> The following formula:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)(a)">(a)</span> Subtract the existing square footage from the gross area baseline; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="J(1)(b)">(b)</span> Then use the lesser of that amount or the actual area of the addition when calculating the maximum State construction allocation according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/14.39.02.07#E" title="">Â§E of this regulation</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J(2)">(2)</span> The estimated or actual cost of construction multiplied by the State cost share percentage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> Addition in Conjunction with Renewal or Renovation. When an addition involves both an addition and a renovation or a renewal, the maximum State construction allocation is established by adding the renewal or renovation maximum State construction allocation calculated according to Â§G or H of this regulation and the addition (new construction) maximum State construction allocation calculated according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/14.39.02.07#J" title="">Â§J of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> Replacement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(1)">(1)</span> An LEA that proposes to abandon a facility or demolish more than 50 percent of the gross square footage of a facility shall submit a feasibility study to the reasonable satisfaction of the IAC.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(2)">(2)</span> Based on the review of the feasibility study, the IAC may set the maximum State construction allocation for a replacement school based on the cost of renovating an existing school according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/14.39.02.07#H" title="">Â§H of this regulation</a>, or the cost of building a new school according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/14.39.02.07#G" title="">Â§G of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(3)">(3)</span> If the State approves renovating or renewing an existing school and the LEA builds a replacement school, the IAC may reduce the maximum State construction allocation for that project by 15 percent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L(4)">(4)</span> The IAC or its designee may waive the requirement for a feasibility study on submission of supporting documentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> Forward-Funded Project. If the maximum State construction allocation for a forward-funded project is calculated according to the formulas in Â§G, H, or I of this regulation, the following factors shall be applied:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(1)">(1)</span> Gross area baseline that applied on the bid-opening date, using the 7-year enrollment projections applied as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="M(1)(a)">(a)</span> If the bid opening was between October 1 and March 31, the prior September 30 enrollment is used as the approved student enrollment; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="M(1)(b)">(b)</span> If the bid opening was between April 1 and September 30, the September 30 enrollment at the end of that time frame is used as the approved student enrollment;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(2)">(2)</span> Average square foot school building cost published by the IAC or its designee for the July that falls within the calendar year of the bid-opening date;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(3)">(3)</span> State cost share percentage that applied on the bid-opening date; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M(4)">(4)</span> For a renovation project, the amount of the awarded scope of work, not to exceed the maximum State construction allocation as developed in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/14.39.02.07#H(1)(a)" title="">Â§H(1)(a) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Cooperative Use Space.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)">(1)</span> The maximum State construction allocation for an approved project may include the State's share of eligible costs to construct or renovate up to 3,000 gross square feet of co-located or shared space to support LEA or community initiatives to serve school children and the general community.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(2)">(2)</span> This cooperative use space is in addition to the size of typical school-function areas provided by the LEA.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(3)">(3)</span> There shall be a written agreement between the county board and the space occupant that establishes the term and conditions.</p>
