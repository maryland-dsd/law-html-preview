                <p>Whenever a conversion privilege is available under the policy or whenever a policy which is not eligible for renewal as a wholesale life insurance policy may be continued by payment of an increased premium, the insurer shall give the individual employee or member insured written notice of the right to convert or continue. The notice shall be given not more than 60 days before or more than 15 days after the termination or nonrenewal of insurance under the wholesale life insurance policy. If the notice is given more than 15 days after termination or nonrenewal of insurance, the time allowed for the exercise of the privilege of conversion or payment of the increased premium shall be extended for 15 days after the giving of the notice, but not beyond 90 days after the termination or nonrenewal of insurance. An extension of the time to convert or continue the policy does not operate to extend the coverage beyond the period stated in the policy, unless the policy specifically provides for an extension of the coverage. Written notice under this provision may be given by timely mailing of the notice to the employee or member insured at the employee's or member's most recent address known to the insurer or to the sponsor. Notice described in this regulation is not required when the policy may be continued as a wholesale life insurance policy with the same sponsor at an increased premium which is called for in the policy's schedule of premiums because of an increase in the attained age of the person insured or because of a change in the table of rates stated in the policy. In event of a change in the table of rates, notice shall be given as set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.01.03#B" title="">Regulation .03B of this chapter</a>.</p>

The policy shall contain all of the provisions required by §§B—M of this regulation, except that any provision or portion thereof which in the opinion of the Commissioner is not applicable to the plan of insurance shall, to the extent inapplicable, not be incorporated in the policy. In lieu of any of the provisions required by this chapter, the Commissioner may approve any provision which he deems more favorable to the policyholder.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.01.08#B">B.</span> Grace Period. A grace period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed within which the payment of any premium payable under the policy (except the first premium) may be made, during which grace period the policy shall continue in full force. If a claim arises under the policy during the grace period, the insurer may deduct the amount of any premium due from the policy proceeds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.01.08#C">C.</span> Incontestability. The policy shall be incontestable as to life insurance benefits (exclusive of additional benefits relating to disability or accidental death), except for nonpayment of premium, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of 2 years from its date of issue.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.01.08#D">D.</span> Entire Contract. The policy shall provide that it, or it together with any application for a policy if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, shall constitute the entire contract between the insurer and the policyholder, and if the application is so made a part of the policy, that all statements contained in the application shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.</p>

The policy shall have endorsed on it, or on an application attached to it, the name of the beneficiary and reserve to the policy owner the right to change the beneficiary unless the owner elects to designate a beneficiary irrevocably. The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which may not be less than 30 days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make any payment under the policy to the estate of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to payment by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention, or burial of the insured. The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to any other payment due under the policy. At the option of the insurer, the policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until endorsed on the policy by the insurer, or otherwise accepted by the insurer, and that the insurer may refuse to endorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. If the policy provides that the proceeds may be payable in installments or as an annuity, the policy shall include a table showing the amount and period of the installment or annuity if determinable at issue.</p>

The policy shall provide that unless it has been surrendered for its cash surrender value, or its cash surrender value has been exhausted by reason of policy indebtedness, or the paid-up term insurance, if any, has expired, the policy may be reinstated at any time within 3 years from the due date of the first premium in default upon written application to the insurer and the production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer, and the payment of all premiums in arrears and payment or reinstatement of any other indebtedness to the insurer upon the policy and the payment of interest at a specified rate not exceeding an effective rate of 6 percent per annum compounded annually on all premiums in arrears and indebtedness.</p>

The policy shall contain a provision that after 3 full years premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest not exceeding an effective rate of 6 percent per annum, an amount equal to or, at the option of the person entitled to payment, less than the loan value of the policy. The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, then the policy shall terminate and become void, but not until at least 30 days notice has been mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the insured or policy owner and of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for 6 months after application therefor. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the person entitled to elect. At the option of the insurer, this provision may be omitted in a policy of term life insurance.</p>

An insurer seeking approval to enter into the variable life insurance business in this State shall adopt by formal action of its board of directors and file with the Commissioner a written statement specifying the standards of suitability to be used by the insurer and applicable to its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents with respect to the suitability of variable life insurance for the applicant. These standards of suitability shall be binding on the insurer and those to whom it refers, and shall specify that no recommendations shall be made to an applicant to purchase a variable life insurance policy and that no variable life insurance policy may be issued in the absence of reasonable grounds to believe that the purchase of the policy is suitable for the applicant on the basis of information furnished after reasonable inquiry of the applicant concerning the applicant's insurance and investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and any other information known to the insurer or to the agent making the recommendation. Lapse rates for variable life insurance within the first 2 policy years which are significantly higher than both those encountered by the insurer, or an affiliate of the insurer, for corresponding fixed benefit life insurance policies and lapse rates of other insurers issuing variable life insurance policies shall be considered by the Commissioner in determining whether the guidelines adopted by the insurer are reasonable and also whether the insurer and its agents are engaging, as a general business practice, in the sale of variable life insurance to persons for whom it is unsuitable. For purposes of this section, conversions from variable life insurance to fixed benefit life insurance policies pursuant to this chapter will not be considered lapses.</p>

                <p>REPLACEMENT OF LIFE INSURANCE OR ANNUITIES</p>
                <p>This document shall be signed by the applicant and the insurance producer, if there is one, and a copy left with the applicant.</p>
                <p>You are contemplating the purchase of a life insurance policy or annuity contract. In some cases this purchase may involve discontinuing or changing an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract. If so, a replacement is occurring. Financed purchases are also considered replacements.</p>
                <p>A replacement occurs when a new life insurance policy or annuity contract is purchased and, in connection with the sale, you discontinue making premium payments on the existing life insurance policy or annuity contract, or an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract is surrendered, forfeited, assigned to the replacing insurer, or otherwise terminated or used in a financed purchase.</p>
                <p>A financed purchase occurs when the purchase of a new life insurance policy involves the use of funds obtained by the withdrawal or surrender of or by borrowing some or all of the life insurance policy values, including accumulated dividends, of an existing life insurance policy to pay all or part of any premium or payment due on the new life insurance policy. A financed purchase is a replacement.</p>
                <p>You should carefully consider whether a replacement is in your best interest. You will pay acquisition costs and there may be surrender costs deducted from your life insurance policy or annuity contract. You may be able to make changes to your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to meet your insurance needs at less cost. A financed purchase will reduce the value of your existing life insurance policy and may reduce the amount paid upon the death of the insured.</p>
                <p>We want you to understand the effects of replacements before you make your purchase decision and ask that you answer the following questions and consider the questions on the back of this form.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.09.05.10#1">1.</span> Are you considering discontinuing making premium payments, surrendering, forfeiting, assigning to the insurer, or otherwise terminating your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract?</p>

                <p>If you answered "yes" to either of the above questions, list each existing life insurance policy or annuity contract you are contemplating replacing (include the name of the insurer, the insured or annuitant, and the life insurance policy or annuity contract number if available) and whether each life insurance policy or annuity contract will be replaced or used as a source of financing:</p>

                <p>Make sure you know the facts. Contact your existing company or its agent for information about the old life insurance policy or annuity contract. If you request one, an in-force illustration, life insurance policy summary, or available disclosure document must be sent to you by the existing insurer.

                <p>A replacement may not be in your best interest, or your decision could be a good one. You should make a careful comparison of the costs and benefits of your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract and the proposed life insurance policy or annuity contract. One way to do this is to ask the company or insurance producer that sold you your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to provide you with information concerning your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract. This may include an illustration of how your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract is working now and how it would perform in the future based on certain assumptions. Illustrations should not, however, be used as a sole basis to compare life insurance policies or annuity contracts. You should discuss the following with your insurance producer to determine whether replacement or financing your purchase makes sense:</p>
                <p>PREMIUMS: Are they affordable?</p>
                <p>Could they change?</p>
                <p>You are older—are premiums higher for the proposed new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>How long will you have to pay premiums on the new life insurance policy? On the old life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>LIFE INSURANCE POLICY VALUES: New policies usually take longer to build cash values and to pay dividends.</p>
                <p>Acquisition costs for the old life insurance policy may have been paid, and you will incur costs for the new one.</p>
                <p>What surrender charges do the policies have?</p>
                <p>What expense and sales charges will you pay on the new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>Does the new life insurance policy provide more insurance coverage?</p>
                <p>INSURABILITY: If your health has changed since you bought your old life insurance policy, the new one could cost you more, or you could be turned down.</p>
                <p>You may need a medical exam for a new life insurance policy.</p>
                <p>Claims on most new policies for up to the first 2 years can be denied based on inaccurate statements.</p>
                <p>Suicide limitations may begin anew on the new coverage.</p>
                <p>IF YOU ARE KEEPING THE OLD LIFE INSURANCE POLICY AS WELL AS THE NEW LIFE INSURANCE POLICY:</p>
                <p>How are premiums for both policies being paid?</p>
                <p>How will the premiums on your existing life insurance policy be affected?</p>
                <p>Will a loan be deducted from death benefits?</p>
                <p>What values from the old life insurance policy are being used to pay premiums?</p>
                <p>IF YOU ARE SURRENDERING AN ANNUITY OR LIFE PRODUCT:</p>
                <p>Will you pay surrender charges on your old annuity contract?</p>
                <p>What are the interest rate guarantees for the new annuity contract?</p>
                <p>Have you compared the annuity contract charges or other life insurance policy expenses?</p>
                <p>OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER FOR ALL TRANSACTIONS:</p>
                <p>What are the tax consequences of buying the new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>Is this a tax-free exchange? (See your tax advisor.)</p>
                <p>Is there a benefit from favorable "grandfathered" treatment of the old life insurance policy under the Internal Revenue Code?</p>
                <p>Will the existing insurer be willing to modify the old life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>How does the quality and financial stability of the new company compare with your existing company?</p>

                <p>REPLACING YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OR ANNUITY?</p>
                <p>Are you thinking about buying a new life insurance policy or annuity and discontinuing or changing an existing one? If you are, your decision could be a good one—or a mistake. You will not know for sure unless you make a careful comparison of your existing benefits and the proposed life insurance policy or annuity contract's benefits.</p>
                <p>Make sure you understand the facts. You should ask the company or insurance producer that sold you your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to give you information about it.</p>
                <p>Hear both sides before you decide. This way you can be sure you are making a decision that is in your best interest.</p>

                <p>Make sure you know the facts. Contact your existing company or its insurance producer for information about the old life insurance policy or annuity contract. If you request one, an in-force illustration, life insurance policy summary, or available disclosure document must be sent to you by the existing insurer. Ask for and keep all sales material used by the insurance producer in the sales presentation. Be sure that you make an informed decision.</p>

                <p>A replacement may not be in your best interest, or your decision could be a good one. You should make a careful comparison of the costs and benefits of your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract and the proposed life insurance policy or annuity contract. One way to do this is to ask the company or insurance producer that sold you your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to provide you with information concerning your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract. This may include an illustration of how your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract is working now and how it would perform in the future based on certain assumptions. Illustrations should not, however, be used as a sole basis to compare policies or annuity contracts. You should discuss the following with your agent to determine whether replacement or financing your purchase makes sense:</p>
                <p>PREMIUMS: Are they affordable?</p>
                <p>Could they change?</p>
                <p>You are older—are premiums higher for the proposed new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>How long will you have to pay premiums on the new life insurance policy? On the old life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>LIFE INSURANCE POLICY VALUES: New policies usually take longer to build cash values and to pay dividends.</p>
                <p>Acquisition costs for the old life insurance policy may have been paid, and you will incur costs for the new one.</p>
                <p>What surrender charges do the policies have?</p>
                <p>What expense and sales charges will you pay on the new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>Does the new life insurance policy provide more insurance coverage?</p>
                <p>INSURABILITY: If your health has changed since you bought your old life insurance policy, the new one could cost you more, or you could be turned down.</p>
                <p>You may need a medical exam for a new life insurance policy.</p>
                <p>Claims on most new policies for up to the first 2 years can be denied based on inaccurate statements.</p>
                <p>Suicide limitations may begin anew on the new coverage.</p>
                <p>IF YOU ARE KEEPING THE OLD LIFE INSURANCE POLICY AS WELL AS THE NEW LIFE INSURANCE POLICY:</p>
                <p>How are premiums for both policies being paid?</p>
                <p>How will the premiums on your existing life insurance policy be affected?</p>
                <p>Will a loan be deducted from death benefits?</p>
                <p>What values from the old life insurance policy are being used to pay premiums?</p>
                <p>IF YOU ARE SURRENDERING AN ANNUITY OR LIFE PRODUCT:</p>
                <p>Will you pay surrender charges on your old annuity contract?</p>
                <p>What are the interest rate guarantees for the new annuity contract?</p>
                <p>Have you compared the annuity contract charges or other life insurance policy expenses?</p>
                <p>OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER FOR ALL TRANSACTIONS:</p>
                <p>What are the tax consequences of buying the new life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>Is this a tax-free exchange? (See your tax advisor.)</p>
                <p>Is there a benefit from favorable "grandfathered" treatment of the old life insurance policy under the Internal Revenue Code?</p>
                <p>Will the existing insurer be willing to modify the old life insurance policy?</p>
                <p>How does the quality and financial stability of the new company compare with your existing company?</p>

                <p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules for life insurance policy illustrations that will protect consumers and foster consumer education. The chapter provides illustration formats, prescribes standards to be followed when illustrations are used, and specifies the disclosures that are required in connection with illustrations. The goals of this chapter are to ensure that illustrations do not mislead purchasers of life insurance and to make illustrations more understandable.

                <p class="center ">"Statement of Actuarial Opinion for Interest-Indexed Universal Life Insurance Policies</p>
                <p>I, {insert name of actuary}, am {insert position or relationship to Insurer} for the XYZ Life Insurance Company (The Insurer) in the state of {Insert State of Domicile of Insurer}.</p>
                <p>I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries (or if not, state other qualifications to sign annual statement actuarial opinions).</p>
                <p>I have examined the interest-indexed universal life insurance policies of the Insurer in force as of December 31, 20XX, encompassing _______ number of policies and $__________ of insurance in force.</p>
                <p>I have considered the provisions of the policies. I have considered any reinsurance agreements pertaining to such policies, the characteristics of the identified assets, and the investment policy adopted by the Insurer as they affect future insurance and investment cash flows under such policies and related assets. My examination included such tests and calculations as I considered necessary to form an opinion concerning the insurance and investment cash flows arising from the policies and related assets.</p>
                <p>I relied on the investment policy of the Insurer and on projected investment cash flows as provided by __________________________, Chief Investment Officer of the Insurer.</p>
                <p>The tests were conducted under various assumptions as to future interest rates, and particular attention was given to those provisions and characteristics that might cause future insurance and investment cash flows to vary with changes in the level of prevailing interest rates.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, the anticipated insurance and investment cash flows referred to above make good and sufficient provision for the contractual obligations of the Insurer under these insurance policies.</p>
