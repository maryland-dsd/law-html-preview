The total monetary value of the consideration, that is, of all those things which in fact are, or are promised to be, paid or delivered by or on behalf of the purchaser, to or on behalf of the vendor in the consummation and complete performance of a sale, whether or not the vendor receives any benefit from them, constitutes the "price" on which the tax is to be computed. Deductions are not permitted for any expense or cost, including the cost of any labor or service rendered, any material used or any property sold regardless of how any contract, invoice or other evidence of the transaction is stated or computed, except for those items specifically described in §D, or in Regulation .10 with respect to certain utilities or Regulation .28 with respect to leases.</p>

                <p>In general, ice, including ice for household consumption, is not food for sales and use tax purposes. If, however, ice is sold as a component of food, such as in a beverage other than an alcoholic beverage, the provisions of the law concerning the sale of food shall apply. In all other instances, the sale of ice, including the sale of ice sculptures, is subject to taxation to the same extent as other tangible personal property. For example, if ice is used for packing a commodity during shipment, and title to the ice will pass to the buyer along with the commodity, the packer may issue a resale certificate for the ice. If, however, only the commodity and not the ice will be transferred, the purchase of the ice is taxable.</p>

If a suit is normally priced at $225 on a single price tag, the suit cannot be split into separate articles so that any of the components may be sold for $100 or less in order to qualify for the exemption.

If a customer purchases a pair of shoes priced at $110 with a manufacturer's coupon worth $10 off, the consideration paid for the pair of shoes totals $110 and the shoes do not qualify for the exemption.</p>

Having advertised that the second pair is half price, the store cannot ring up each pair of shoes for $75 in order for the items to qualify for the exemption.
