During this interim period, a hospital may seek a rate adjustment under any other administrative remedy available to it under existing Commission law, regulation, or policy. In no event shall this moratorium continue in effect beyond June 30, 2023. Once the moratorium is lifted, a hospital may file a regular rate application at any time if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> The rates being requested are not the subject of a hospital-instituted case pending before the Commission; or</p>

For purposes of this regulation, unnecessary or potentially avoidable utilization means the utilization of health care items and services, including care furnished to treat complications during a hospital admission, that may be avoided through improved efficiency, care coordination, or effective community-based care, or that is not medically necessary or evidence-based care.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> In establishing a reasonable level of uncompensated care in a full rate review, the Commission shall consider for each hospital the:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(a)">(a)</span> Amount of uncompensated care actually incurred;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)">(b)</span> Predicted amount of uncompensated care; and</p>
