During this interim period, a hospital may seek a rate adjustment under any other administrative remedy available to it under existing Commission law, regulation, or policy. In no event shall this moratorium continue in effect beyond June 30, 2023. Once the moratorium is lifted, a hospital may file a regular rate application at any time if:</p>
