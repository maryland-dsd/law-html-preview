                <p>This chapter describes the Maryland Intergovernmental Review and Coordination Process, the State process for collecting and transmitting the views of State, regional, and local officials in Maryland on specific applications for federal and State financial assistance, for direct federal development, and for certain planning and other activities requiring intergovernmental coordination. These procedural regulations are intended to secure the benefits of intergovernmental cooperation by providing a sure and simple means for learning about and commenting on specific federal and State applications. They are not intended and may not be construed to abridge the statutory authority of approving authorities, or to create any right or benefit enforceable at law, in equity, or otherwise by any party against the Department, other State or local agencies, or their officials.</p>

                <p>These regulations are applicable to all State-owned real property except that the following State-owned property need not be reported as excess property:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/34.02.02.01#A">A.</span> Residential property acquired by the Department of Economic and Community Development by foreclosure or similar means in the course of operation of a State lending or insuring program administered by that department;</p>

                <p>Proper management and use of State resources requires a continuing and critical review of the real property held by the State to assure that it is being properly utilized. All State agencies are encouraged to initiate and conduct on a continuing basis a survey of all real property under their control and jurisdiction to identify those properties which are not utilized, are under-utilized, or are not being put to optimum use and are not required to meet future needs. These regulations are intended to provide guidance to State agencies for the reporting of excess and substantial changes in State- owned real property and requests for the granting of rights-of-way or easements and to establish the coordination procedures associated with the reports submitted. This program will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the acquisition of real property when State agency needs can be met by utilizing real property currently owned by the State, and insure that maximum benefits to the State are realized by the utilization or disposal of this property for the most appropriate use which is compatible with the plans and programs of State and local agencies. Further, it will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the operation, care, and maintenance of property not needed to meet current or projected requirements.</p>
