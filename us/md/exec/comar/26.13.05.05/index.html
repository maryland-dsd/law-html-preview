                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(a)">(a)</span> Upon delivery of the hazardous waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator shall sign and date each copy of the paper replacement manifest by hand in Item 20 (Designated Facility Certification of Receipt) and note any discrepancies in Item 18 (Discrepancy Indication Space) of the paper replacement manifest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(b)">(b)</span> The owner or operator of the facility shall give back to the final transporter one copy of the paper replacement manifest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(c)">(c)</span> Within 30 days of delivery of the waste to the designated facility, the owner or operator of the facility shall send one signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the generator, and send an additional signed and dated copy of the paper replacement manifest to the electronic manifest system; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)(d)">(d)</span> The owner or operator of the facility shall retain at the facility one copy of the paper replacement manifest for at least 3 years from the date of delivery.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> Special Procedures Applicable to Electronic Signature Methods Undergoing Tests. If an owner or operator using an electronic manifest signs this manifest electronically using an electronic signature method which is undergoing pilot or demonstration tests aimed at demonstrating the practicality or legal dependability of the signature method, then the owner or operator shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(a)">(a)</span> Also sign with an ink signature the facility's certification of receipt or discrepancies on the printed copy of the manifest provided by the transporter; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)(b)">(b)</span> Upon executing the owner or operator's ink signature on the printed copy of the manifest provided by the transporter, the owner or operator shall retain this original copy among the facility's records for at least 3 years from the date of delivery of the waste.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)">(10)</span> Electronic Manifest Signatures. An electronic signature method used in connection with the electronic manifest system is acceptable only if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(a)">(a)</span> Use of the method results in the creation of a legally valid and enforceable signature under applicable EPA and other federal requirements pertaining to electronic signatures; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(b)">(b)</span> The method has been designed and implemented in a manner that EPA considers to be as cost-effective and practical as possible for the users of the manifest.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(a)">(a)</span> After a facility has certified to the receipt of hazardous wastes by signing Item 20 of the manifest, any post-receipt data corrections may be submitted at any time by any interested person shown on the manifest, such as a waste handler.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(b)">(b)</span> An interested person shall make all corrections to manifest data by electronic submission, either by directly entering corrected data to the web-based service provided in the electronic manifest system for corrections, or by an upload of a data file containing data corrections relating to one or more previously submitted manifests.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(c)">(c)</span> A person submitting a correction shall include the following information as part of the submission:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(d)(i)">(i)</span> Shall include as part of the submission a statement that the person submitting the corrections certifies that, to the best of the person's knowledge or belief, the corrections that are included in the submission will cause the information reported about the previously received hazardous wastes to be true, accurate, and complete;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(11)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> Shall execute the certification statement with a valid electronic signature; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1">Agency Note: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency assesses an owner or operator who is a user of the electronic manifest system a user fee as prescribed in 40 CFR Â§264.311 and determined in 40 CFR Â§1312. EPA periodically updates the schedule of user fees and publishes the updated fee schedule to ensure that the e-manifest user community is aware of the revisions, as provided in 40 CFR Â§264.1313. An owner or operator subject to these user fees is required by EPA to make user fee payments in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Â§264.1314, subject to the informal fee dispute resolution process of 40 CFR Â§264.1316, and subject to the sanctions for delinquent payments under 40 CFR Â§264.1315.</p>
