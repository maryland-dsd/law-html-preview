                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(8)">(8)</span> If a falconer receiving a raptor is not at the immediate location where the bird is taken from the wild, the individual who removes the bird from the wild shall be a general or master falconer, and shall report take of the bird. The bird will count as one of the two raptors the individual who took it from the wild is allowed to capture in any year. The individual who takes the bird from the wild shall report the take even if the individual promptly transfers the bird to another falconer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(9)">(9)</span> If a falconer has a long-term or permanent physical impairment that prevents the falconer from attending the capture of a species the falconer can use for falconry, a general or master falconer may capture a bird for that falconer. That falconer is then responsible for filing a USFWS form 3-186A reporting take of the bird from the wild, and the bird will count against the take of wild raptors that falconer is allowed in any year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(10)">(10)</span> A falconer may not intentionally capture a raptor species that the falconer’s classification does not allow the falconer to possess for falconry.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(14)">(14)</span> A falconer may recapture a raptor wearing falconry equipment, such as jesses, or a captive-bred bird at any time, even if the falconer is not allowed to possess the species. The bird will not count against the falconer’s possession limit nor will its take from the wild count against that limit. The falconer shall report the recapture of the bird to the Department no more than 5 working days after the recapture. The falconer shall return a recaptured falconry bird to the individual who lost it, if that individual may legally possess it. Disposition of a bird whose legal possession cannot be determined will be at the discretion of the Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(15)">(15)</span> If a raptor, including a peregrine falcon, captured by a falconer is marked with a seamless metal band, a transmitter, or any other item identifying it as a falconry bird, the falconer shall report the capture of the bird to the Department no more than 5 working days after the capture. The falconer shall return a recaptured falconry bird to the individual who lost it. If that individual cannot possess the bird or does not wish to possess it, the falconer may keep it. Otherwise, disposition of a bird whose legal possession cannot be determined will be at the discretion of the Department. While the falconer keeps a bird for return to the individual who lost it, the bird will not count against that falconer’s possession limit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(16)">(16)</span> If a falconer captures a peregrine falcon that has a research band, such as a colored band with alphanumeric codes, or a research marking attached to it, the falconer shall immediately release the bird, except that if the falcon has a transmitter attached to it, the falconer is authorized to possess the bird up to 30 days if the falconer wishes to contact the researcher to determine if the researcher wishes to replace the transmitter or its batteries. If the researcher wishes to do so, or to have the transmitter removed, the researcher or the researcher’s designee can make the change or allow the falconer to do so before the falconer releases the bird.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(17)">(17)</span> If a raptor captured by a falconer has any other band, research marking, or transmitter attached to it, the falconer shall promptly report the band numbers and all other relevant information to the federal Bird Banding Laboratory.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(19)(a)">(a)</span> The falconer may put the bird on a falconry permit. The falconer shall report take of the bird by entering the required information in the USFWS electronic database or by submitting a USFWS form 3-186A the Department at the first opportunity to do so, but no more than 10 days after capture of the bird. The falconer shall then have the bird treated by a veterinarian or a permitted wildlife rehabilitator. The bird will count against the falconer’s possession limit; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(19)(b)">(b)</span> The falconer may give the bird directly to a veterinarian or a permitted wildlife rehabilitator authorized to possess migratory birds.

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)(a)">(a)</span> For imping, a falconer may possess flight feathers for each species of raptor the falconer possess or previously held for as long as the falconer has a valid falconry permit. A falconer may receive feathers for imping from other permitted falconers, wildlife rehabilitators, or propagators in the United States, and a falconer may give feathers to them. A falconer may not buy, sell, or barter such feathers;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)(b)">(b)</span> A falconer may donate feathers from a falconry bird, except golden eagle feathers, to any individual or institution with a valid permit to have them, or to anyone exempt from the permit requirement under federal regulation 50 CFR §21.12;</p>

If permitted to do so, the falconer shall allow the bird to adjust to the wild at an appropriate time of year and an appropriate location. The falconer shall leave the seamless band on the bird. The falconer shall report release of the bird by entering the required information in the USFWS electronic database or by submitting a USFWS form 3-186A to the Department; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(5)(b)">(b)</span> If the species to be released is native to the State and was taken from the wild, a falconer may release the bird only at an appropriate time of year and an appropriate location. The falconer shall remove its falconry band and report release of the bird by entering the required information in the USFWS electronic database or by submitting a USFWS form 3-186A to the Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(6)">(6)</span> A falconer may use raptors possessed for falconry in captive propagation if the falconer or the individual overseeing the propagation has the necessary federal permit. The falconer does not need to transfer a bird from the falconer’s falconry permit if the falconer uses it for fewer than 8 months in a year in captive propagation, but the falconer shall do so if the falconer permanently transfers the bird for propagation. The bird shall then be banded as required in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/08.03.09.07#D" title="">§D of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(7)">(7)</span> A general or master falconer may only use a falconry bird the falconer possesses in conservation education programs presented in public venues provided that:</p>

The following conditions shall be adhered to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(8)(a)">(a)</span> A falconer may not use falconry raptors to make movies or commercials or in other commercial ventures that are not related to falconry; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)">(9)</span> A general or master falconer may assist a State and federally permitted migratory bird rehabilitator to condition raptors in preparation for their release to the wild. The falconer may keep a bird the falconer is helping to rehabilitate in the falconer’s facilities. The following conditions shall be adhered to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)(a)">(a)</span> The rehabilitator shall provide the falconer with a letter or form that identifies the bird and explains that the falconer is assisting in its rehabilitation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)(b)">(b)</span> The falconer does not need to meet the rehabilitator facility standards. The falconer need only meet the facility standards in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/08.03.09.07#F" title="">§F of this regulation</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)(c)">(c)</span> The falconer does not have to add any raptor the falconer possesses for this purpose to the falconer’s permit; it will remain under the permit of the rehabilitator;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)(d)">(d)</span> The falconer shall return any such bird that cannot be permanently released to the wild to the rehabilitator for placement within the 180–day time frame in which the rehabilitator is authorized to possess the bird, unless the Department authorizes the falconer to retain the bird for longer than 180 days; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(9)(e)">(e)</span> Upon coordination with the rehabilitator, the falconer shall release all releasable raptors to the wild or return them to the rehabilitator for release within the 180–day timeframe in which the rehabilitator is authorized to possess the birds, unless the Department authorizes the falconer to retain and condition a bird for longer than 180 days, or unless the rehabilitator transfers the bird to the falconer to hold under the falconer’s permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(10)">(10)</span> The carcasses of dead falconry birds shall be disposed of as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(10)(a)">(a)</span> The falconer shall send the entire body of a golden eagle held for falconry, including all feathers, talons, and other parts, to the National Eagle Repository;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(10)(c)">(c)</span> If the bird was banded or microchipped prior to its death, the falconer may keep the body of any falconry raptor except that of a golden eagle. The falconer may keep the body so that the feathers are available for imping, or the falconer may have the body mounted by a taxidermist. The falconer may use the mount in giving conservation education programs. If the bird was banded, the falconer shall leave the band on the body. If the bird has an implanted microchip, the falconer shall leave the microchip in place;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(10)(d)">(d)</span> If the falconer does not wish to donate the bird body or feathers or keep it, the falconer shall burn, bury, or otherwise destroy it within 10 days of the death of the bird or after final examination by a veterinarian to determine the cause of death. Carcasses of euthanized raptors could pose a risk of secondary poisoning of eagles and other scavengers. The falconer shall take appropriate precautions to avoid such poisonings; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(11)">(11)</span> While practicing falconry, a falconer shall ensure that the falconer’s activities do not cause the take of federally listed threatened or endangered wildlife. Take under the federal Endangered Species Act means to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct. Within this definition, harass means any act that may injure wildlife by disrupting normal behavior, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering, and harm means an act that actually kills or injures wildlife.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(12)">(12)</span> If a falconer moves to a new state, within 30 days the falconer shall inform both the Department and the permitting authority for the falconer’s new place of residence of the falconer’s address change. To obtain a new falconry permit, the falconer shall follow the permit application procedures of the authority under which the falconer wishes to acquire a new permit. The falconer may keep falconry birds while applying for a new falconry permit. However, the State, tribe, or territory into which the falconer moves may place restrictions on the possession of falconry birds until the falconer meets the residency requirements there.</p>
