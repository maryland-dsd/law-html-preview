A person engaged in business as a producer, manufacturer, bottler, importer, wholesaler, or retail dealer of distilled spirits or wines, directly or indirectly, or through an affiliate, may not publish or disseminate or cause to be published or disseminated in any newspaper, magazine, or similar publication any advertisement for distilled spirits or wines, unless the advertisement is in conformity with this regulation. These provisions may not apply to the publisher of any newspaper, magazine, or similar publication unless the publisher is engaged in business as a producer, manufacturer, bottler, importer, wholesaler, or retail dealer of distilled spirits or wines, directly or indirectly, or through an affiliate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> For the purpose of this regulation, "advertisement" includes any advertisement of distilled spirits or wines through the medium of newspapers, magazines, or similar publications, except that the term may not include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Any label affixed to any container of distilled spirits or wines, or any individual covering, carton, or other wrapper of the container;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Mandatory Statements.</p>

In the case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, and specialties) produced by blending or rectification, if neutral spirits have been used in the production of it, there shall be stated in the advertisement the percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from which the neutral spirits have been distilled in substantially the manner and form in which these statements appear on the labels of the distilled spirits advertised. In the case of neutral spirits or of gin produced by a process of continuous distillation, there shall be stated in the advertisement the name of the commodity from which the neutral spirits or gin has been distilled substantially in the manner and form in which this statement appears on the labels of the distilled spirits advertised.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(e)">(e)</span> "Line" or "Brand" Advertisements.

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(i)">(i)</span> Any statement that is false or misleading.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(iv)">(iv)</span> Any statement, design, device, or representation of, or relating to, analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which is likely to mislead the consumer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(v)">(v)</span> Any statement, design, device, or representation of, or relating to, any guaranty, irrespective of falsity, which is likely to mislead the consumer. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use of any enforceable guaranty in substantially the following form: "We will refund the purchase price to the purchaser if he is in any manner dissatisfied with the contents of this package ---------- Blank to be filled in with the name of the person making guarantee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(vi)">(vi)</span> Any statement that the product is produced, blended, made, bottled, packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any authorization, law, or regulation of any municipality, county, or State, federal, or foreign government unless the statement is required or specifically authorized by the laws or regulations of that government. If a municipal, county, State, or federal permit number is stated, the permit number may not be accompanied by any additional statement relating to it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(b)">(b)</span> Statements Inconsistent with Labeling. The advertisement may not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of distilled spirits or wines that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling of it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(c)">(c)</span> Curative and Therapeutic Effects. The advertisement may not contain any statement, design, or device representing that the use of any distilled spirits or wines has curative or therapeutic effects, if the statement is untrue in any particular, or tends to create a misleading impression. Examples of these statements are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(c)(i)">(i)</span> " ---------- is good for you";</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(d)">(d)</span> Place of Origin. The advertisement may not represent that the distilled spirits or wines were manufactured in, or imported from, a place or country other than that of their actual origin, or were produced or processed by one who was not in fact the actual producer or processor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(e)">(e)</span> Flags, Seals, Coats of Arms, Crests, and Other Insignia.

An advertisement may not contain any statement, device, design, or pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or other insignia, likely to lead the consumer to believe falsely that the product has been endorsed, made, used by, produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or individual with whom that flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(f)">(f)</span> Examples of prohibited statements are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(f)(i)">(i)</span> Reproduction of medals or facsimiles of awards, when no medals or awards have been given or when the medals or awards were not given on a competitive or comparative basis. For example, "Genuine Sherry is made only in Spain".</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(f)(ii)">(ii)</span> "Contains no neutral spirits or alcohol" or "This rum will not turn dark in the bottle" or "All good wines are bottled at the winery".</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(f)(iii)">(iii)</span> "Analyzed by the Laboratory and found to be pure free from deleterious ingredients", "Tested and approved", or "Signed by The Research Institute".</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> Other Prohibited Statements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(a)">(a)</span> Restrictions. An advertisement for distilled spirits may not contain the words "bond", "bonded", "bottled in bond", "aged in bond", or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, unless those words or phrases appear upon the labels of the distilled spirits advertised, and are stated in the advertisement in the manner and form in which they appear upon the label.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(b)">(b)</span> Statements of Age. An advertisement for distilled spirits may not contain any statement, design, or device directly or by implication concerning age or maturity of any brand or lot of distilled spirits unless a statement of age appears on the labels of the advertised product. When this statement, design, or device concerning age or maturity is contained in any advertisement, it shall include (in direct conjunction with it and with substantially equal conspicuousness) all parts of the statement concerning age and percentages, if any, which appear on the label. However, an advertisement for any whiskey or brandy, which does not bear a statement of age on the label, or an advertisement for rum which is 4 years old or older, may contain general inconspicuous age, maturity, or other similar representations, such as "Aged in wood", and "Mellowed in fine oak casks."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(c)">(c)</span> Restrictions. An advertisement for wine may not contain:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Any statement of bonded winecellar and bonded winery numbers unless stated in direct conjunction with the name and address of the person operating that winery or storeroom. Statement of bonded winecellar and bonded winery numbers may be made in the following form: "Bonded Winecellar No.--", "Bonded Winery No.--", "B.W.C. No.--", "B.W. No.--". An additional reference to that statement may not be made, or may any use be made of that statement that may convey the impression that the wine has been made or matured under U.S. Government or any State Government supervision or in accordance with U.S. Government or any State Government specifications or standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(c)(ii)">(ii)</span> Any statement, design, device, or representation which relates to alcoholic content or which tends to create the impression that a wine is "unfortified" or has been "fortified", or has intoxicating qualities, or contains distilled spirits (except for a reference to distilled spirits in a statement of composition when the statement is required by this regulation to appear as a part of the designation of the product).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(d)">(d)</span> Statement of Age. A statement of age or representation relative to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) may not be made, except that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(d)(i)">(i)</span> In the case of vintage wine, the year of vintage may be stated if it appears on the label;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> Truthful references of a general and informative nature relating to methods of production involving storage or aging, such as "This wine has been mellowed in oak casks", "Stored in small barrels", or "Matured at regulated temperatures in our cellars" may be made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(e)">(e)</span> Statement of Bottling Dates. The statement of any bottling date may not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if the statement appears without undue emphasis in the following form: "Bottled in--" (inserting the year in which the wine was bottled).</p>
