                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> Requires the participating organization and each authorized user to comply with all applicable federal and State privacy and security laws; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)(b)">(b)</span> If the participating organization will maintain Part 2 information, the business associate agreement shall comply with the additional requirements that apply to a qualified service organization under 42 C.F.R. §2.11.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> Permits PHI disclosed through the HIE to the authorized user of a participating organization to be incorporated into the patient’s medical record kept by such participating organization, and requires compliance with all applicable federal and State laws.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> An HIE shall only disclose PHI through an HIE for a primary use consistent with the following:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> All disclosures shall be in full compliance with these regulations.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(a)">(a)</span> The HIE access matrix shall be used for the following purposes:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> To assign an HIE access level to each staff member of the HIE or its contractor that allows only the minimum necessary access to PHI to perform that staff member’s authorized purpose; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> To assist each participating organization and its system administrator in assigning the appropriate HIE access level to each authorized user of that participating organization.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(b)">(b)</span> The HIE shall review its HIE access matrix annually and revise it as necessary to reflect relevant changes in technology, standards, or law; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> Provide technical assistance and guidance to the system administrator of each participating organization in assigning the appropriate HIE access level to each of its authorized users;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> Comply, at a minimum, with the most recent Level 2 requirements set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as set forth in April 2006 in Special Publication 800-63 (Version 1.0.2): Electronic Authentication Guideline for both Registrations and for Registration Record Retention; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)">(4)</span> Adopt and implement an authentication process that:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(b)">(b)</span> Requires a single factor authentication with two characteristics that include a user name and a password, along with an additional security precaution, which may include a security question or a device registration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)(c)">(c)</span> Ensures that the data stored in the HIE that is used to authenticate an authorized user is encrypted to the level set by industry best practices; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> Accept as valid a third party system’s authentication of an authorized user accessing the HIE through that third party system, as long as such access and third party system:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)">(a)</span> Permits the HIE to audit and monitor the user’s HIE activities; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(b)">(b)</span> The HIE has received written assurances from the third party system that it is compliant with these regulations and all applicable federal and State privacy and security regulations.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> The system administrator and HIE shall coordinate with the Commission to determine a methodology for assigning each authorized user with a unique user name and password and to assure that all HIEs use a commonly accepted protocol to avoid the possibility of duplicate user names and passwords.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> The system administrator, in coordination with the HIE, shall assign to each authorized user an access level that appropriately corresponds to that individual’s role within the participating organization and the permitted access to PHI available through the HIE on behalf of the participating organization.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(4)">(4)</span> The system administrator shall modify in a timely manner an authorized user’s access level as appropriate to reflect any change in that individual’s role within the participating organization; and</p>
