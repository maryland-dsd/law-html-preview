                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> The policy contains no provision which excludes or restricts liability for death caused in a certain specific manner or occurring while the insured has a specified status, except that the policy may exclude death resulting from suicide within 6 months after the effective date of coverage.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)(a)">(a)</span> The policy may provide that the insurer may terminate the insurance within 60 days after the effective date and refund all premiums paid by the debtor if the debtor's true age is greater than the limiting age stated in the policy. The notice of termination shall state that the premium paid by the debtor shall be refunded to the person entitled to it. Under this provision, an insurer using this method shall pay the claim in full if the insurer does not terminate the coverage within 60 days or if the debtor dies within the 60-day period but before notification by the insurer of termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)(b)">(b)</span> The policy may provide that debtors who have reached age 65 on the effective date of the insurance are not eligible for insurance.

On policies issued on the outstanding balance insurance basis, the policy may exclude from the classes eligible for insurance, debtors who have reached age 65, and provide for the termination of insurance or reduction in the amount of insurance upon the debtor's attaining a stated age not less than 65. If premium charges continue to be made beyond the stated age due to misstatement of age of the debtor, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.13.01.13#E(4)(d)" title="">§E(4)(d) of this regulation</a> applies. If premium charges continue to be made beyond the stated age even though the correct age of the debtor is known to the insurer or to the creditor, the insurer shall pay in full any claim for loss occurring during any period for which a premium has been charged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)(c)">(c)</span> The policy may provide that debtors who will have reached age 69 on the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness or, at the option of the insurer, on the expiration date of the insurance, are not eligible for insurance. However if an individual policy or a certificate of insurance issued under a group policy is issued beyond the age limits established in the policy due to misstatement of age of the debtor, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.13.01.13#E(4)(d)" title="">§E(4)(d) of this regulation</a> applies.</p>
