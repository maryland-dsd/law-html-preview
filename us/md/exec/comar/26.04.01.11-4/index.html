                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Sample Siting Plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> No later than March 31, 2016, suppliers shall develop a written sample siting plan, which identifies sampling sites and includes a sample collection schedule and which shall be representative of water throughout the distribution system. These plans are subject to review by the Approving Authority and revision as needed. Suppliers shall collect total coliform samples according to the written sample siting plan. Monitoring required by this regulation may take place at a customer's premise, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance sampling location. Routine and repeat sample sites and any sampling points necessary to meet the requirements of Regulation .11-2 shall be included in the sampling plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> Suppliers shall collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that suppliers that use only ground water and serve 4,900 or fewer people may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(c)">(c)</span> Suppliers shall take at least the minimum number of required samples even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#I(1)" title="">§I(1) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(d)">(d)</span> A supplier may conduct more compliance monitoring than is required by this regulation to investigate potential problems in the distribution system and use monitoring as a tool to assist in uncovering problems. A supplier may take more than the minimum number of required routine samples and shall include the results in calculating whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#I(1)(a)" title="">§I(1)(a) of this regulation</a> has been exceeded if the samples are taken in accordance with the existing sample siting plan and are representative of water throughout the distribution system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(e)">(e)</span> Suppliers shall identify repeat monitoring locations in the sample siting plan according to the requirements of 40 CFR §141.853(a) which is incorporated by reference.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Special purpose samples. Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are sufficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, may not be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded. Repeat samples taken according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#H" title="">§H of this regulation</a> are not considered special purpose samples, and shall be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> Invalidation of total coliform samples. A total coliformpositive sample invalidated under this section does not count toward meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)">(a)</span> The Approving Authority may invalidate a total coliformpositive sample if the one of the following conditions are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive result;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The Approving Authority, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collected as required under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#H" title="">§H of this regulation</a>, determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other nondistribution system plumbing problem.  The Approving Authority cannot invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat sample(s) collected at a location other than the original tap are total coliform-negative; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> The Approving Authority has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform-positive result is due to a circumstance or condition that does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case, the supplier shall still collect all repeat samples required under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#H" title="">§H of this regulation</a>, and use them to determine whether a coliform treatment technique trigger in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#I" title="">§I of this regulation</a> has been exceeded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)(b)">(b)</span> A laboratory shall invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected) if the sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique), produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g., Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the supplier shall collect another sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The supplier shall continue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The Approving Authority may waive the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the Approving Authority may implement criteria for waiving the 24-hoursampling time limit to use in lieu of case-by-case extensions.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="I(4)(d)">(d)</span> Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the supplier, the Approving Authority shall determine if the supplier has identified a likely cause for the Level 2 trigger and determine whether the supplier has corrected the problem, or has included a schedule acceptable to the Approving Authority for correcting the problem.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(5)">(5)</span> Corrective Action. Suppliers shall correct sanitary defects found through either Level 1 or 2 assessments conducted under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.04.01.11-4#I(2)" title="">§I(2) of this regulation</a>. For corrections not completed by the time of submission of the assessment form, the supplier shall complete the corrective action(s) in compliance with a timetable approved by the Approving Authority in consultation with the supplier. The supplier shall notify the Approving Authority when each scheduled corrective action is completed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I(6)">(6)</span> Consultation. At any time during the assessment or corrective action phase, either the water supplier or the Approving Authority may request a consultation with the other party to determine the appropriate actions to be taken.
