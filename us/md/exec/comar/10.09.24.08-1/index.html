                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> In determining eligibility for Medical Assistance for any period under consideration beginning on or after October 1, 1993, in the case of assets disposed of after August 10, 1993, a penalty period shall be established during which an individual is determined ineligible for nursing facility services, for a level of care in a medical institution equivalent to that of nursing facility services, and for home and community-based waiver services provided for under the authority of §1915(c) and (d) of the Social Security Act if the individual or the individual's spouse disposes of an asset for less than fair market value at any time during or after the time periods specified under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.24.08-1#B(2)" title="">§B(2) of this regulation</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> For assets other than trusts, the time period for evaluating disposals is the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)(i)">(i)</span> For disposals earlier than February 6, 2006, the 36-month period immediately before the date as of which the individual both is an institutionalized individual and has applied for Medical Assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> For disposals on or after February 6, 2006, the 60-month period immediately before the date as of which the individual both is an institutionalized individual and has applied for Medical Assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> In the case of payments from a trust or portions of a trust that are treated as a disposal of assets under Regulation .08-2B(4)(c), (5)(a)(ii), or (5)(b) of this chapter, the time period for evaluating disposals is the 60-month period immediately before the date as of which the individual both is an institutionalized individual and has applied for Medical Assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> The penalty period begins:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)">(a)</span> For a transfer before February 6, 2006, with the later of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(i)">(i)</span> The first day of the month in which the asset was transferred; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The date on which the individual is eligible for Medical Assistance and, but for the transfer, would be receiving institutional level of care; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)">(b)</span> For a transfer on or after February 6, 2006, with the later of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)(i)">(i)</span> The first day of the month in which the individual is eligible for Medicaid and would be receiving Medicaid nursing facility services but for the application of this penalty; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> The month during or after which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> If the transfer occurs while the individual is in a penalty period for an earlier disposal, the penalty period begins on the first day of the first month following the end of the earlier penalty period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> The number of months in the penalty period are equal to the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred, divided by the average monthly cost, to a private patient at the time of application for Medical Assistance, of nursing facility services in the State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> Asset Transfers For Less Than Average Monthly Cost of Care.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(a)">(a)</span> If the amount of a transfer is less than the average monthly cost of nursing facility services in the State, the length of the penalty period is calculated based on the proportion of the average monthly cost of nursing facility services that was transferred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)(b)">(b)</span> If a series of transfers is made, each of which is less than the average monthly cost of nursing facility services, the penalty period is calculated based on the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred.</p>

If the amount of a single transfer or the amount of the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred is not equally divisible by the average monthly cost of nursing facility services in the State, the length of the penalty period is calculated based on the proportion of the average monthly cost of nursing facility services that was transferred.</p>
