To win the principal minor share, the bettor must correctly select the greatest number of the first three finishers, in exact position, in each of the Quad Trifecta races that is less than all 12. To win the one additional minor share, the bettor must correctly select at least nine or more of the first three finishers, in exact position, in each of the Quad Trifecta races.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(b)">(b)</span> $2 of wagers correctly selected all 12 positions. $2 of wagers correctly selected 11 positions. $3 of wagers correctly selected ten positions. $5 of wagers correctly selected nine positions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(c)">(c)</span> Using a net Quad Trifecta pool of $132,001, and based on the racing association's designations under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/09.10.01.85#G" title="">Â§G of this regulation</a>, the major share of the net Quad Trifecta pool is $100,000, designated for correctly selecting all 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races. The principal minor share of the net Quad Trifecta pool, designated for correctly selecting the next greatest number of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races, is $20,000.40. The one additional minor share of the net Quad Trifecta pool, designated for correctly selecting a range of nine or more of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races, is $12,000.60.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(d)">(d)</span> The major share would be divided among those correctly selecting all 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races. The principal minor share would be divided among those correctly selecting 11 and 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races. The one additional minor share would be divided among all the wagers correctly selecting nine, ten, 11, and 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(e)">(e)</span> The major share of $100,000 would be divided among the $2 of wagers correctly selecting all 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races, yielding an unbroken price of $50,000 per dollar wagered. The principal minor share of $20,000.40 would be divided among the $4 of wagers correctly selecting 11 or more of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races, yielding an unbroken price of $5,000.10 per dollar wagered. The one additional minor share of $12,000.60 would be divided among the $12 of wagers correctly selecting nine or more of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races, yielding an unbroken price of $1,000.05 per dollar wagered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(f)">(f)</span> The sum of $50,000 + $5,000.10 + $1,000.05 = $56,000.15 is the combined unbroken price for correctly choosing all 12 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races. The sum of $5,000.10 + $1,000.05 = $6,000.15 is the combined unbroken price for correctly choosing 11 of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races. $1,000.05 is the unbroken price for correctly selecting nine or ten of the first three finishers, in exact order, in each of the Quad Trifecta races.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K(5)(g)">(g)</span> If the rounding for breakage is to the next lower 10 cents, the final broken prices are $56,000.10 for the winners of the major share, $6,000.10 for the winners of the principal minor share, and $1,000 for the winners of the one additional minor share.</p>
