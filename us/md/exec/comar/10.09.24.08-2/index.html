                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> The individual;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> In the case of a trust, the corpus of which includes assets of one of the individuals described under Â§B(1)(a) or (b) of this regulation and assets of any other individual or individuals, the provisions of this regulation apply to the portion of the trust attributable to the assets of the individual described under Â§B(1)(a) or (b) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> The provisions of this regulation apply without regard to:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)(a)">(a)</span> The corpus of the trust shall be considered resources available to the individual;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> For any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of assets; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)(b)">(b)</span> A portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, a payment could not, under any circumstances, be made to the individual shall be considered to be assets disposed of by the individual, as of the date of establishment of the trust or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed.
