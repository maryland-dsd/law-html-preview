                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of real property and tangible personal property rented to the taxpayer that is located or used within this State during the taxable year, the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned that is located or used within this State during the taxable year, and the average value of the taxpayer's loans and credit card receivables that are located within this State during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the average value of all the property located or used within and without this State during the taxable year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> The property factor shall include only property the income or expenses of which are included, or would have been included if not fully depreciated or expensed, or depreciated or expensed to a nominal amount, in the computation of the apportionable income base for the taxable year.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> The value of real property and tangible personal property owned by the taxpayer is the original cost or other basis of the property for federal income tax purposes without regard to depletion, depreciation, or amortization.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Loans are valued at their outstanding principal balance, without regard to any reserve for bad debts. If a loan is charged-off in whole or in part for federal income tax purposes, the portion of the loan charged off is not outstanding. A specifically allocated reserve established pursuant to regulatory or financial accounting guidelines which is treated as charged-off for federal income tax purposes shall be treated as charged-off for purposes of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> Credit card receivables are valued at their outstanding principal balance, without regard to any reserve for bad debts. If a credit card receivable is charged-off in whole or in part for federal income tax purposes, the portion of the receivable charged-off is not outstanding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> The average value of property owned by the taxpayer is computed on an annual basis by adding the value of the property on the first day of the taxable year and the value on the last day of the taxable year and dividing the sum by two. If averaging on this basis does not properly reflect average value, the Comptroller may require averaging on a more frequent basis. The taxpayer may elect to average on a more frequent basis. When averaging on a more frequent basis is required by the Comptroller or is elected by the taxpayer, the same method of valuation shall be used consistently by the taxpayer with respect to property within and without this State and on all subsequent returns unless the taxpayer receives prior permission from the Comptroller or the Comptroller requires a different method of determining average value.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> If the use of the general method described in this section results in inaccurate valuations of rented property, any other method which properly reflects the value may be adopted by the Comptroller or by the taxpayer when approved in writing by the Comptroller. Once approved, that method of valuation shall be used on all subsequent returns unless the taxpayer receives prior approval from the Comptroller or the Comptroller requires a different method of valuation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> Transportation property is included in the numerator of the property factor to the extent that the property is used in this State. The extent an aircraft will be deemed to be used in this State and the amount of value that is to be included in the numerator of this State's property factor is determined by multiplying the average value of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of the aircraft in this State and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft everywhere. If the extent of the use of any transportation property within this State cannot be determined, then the property will be deemed to be used wholly in the state in which the property has its principal base of operations. A motor vehicle will be deemed to be used wholly in the state in which it is registered.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(c)">(c)</span> The presumption of proper assignment of a loan provided in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/03.04.08.05#G(1)(b)" title="">Â§G(1)(b) of this regulation</a> may be rebutted upon a showing by the Comptroller, supported by a preponderance of the evidence, that the preponderance of substantive contacts regarding the loan did not occur at the regular place of business to which it was assigned on the taxpayer's records. When that presumption has been rebutted, the loan shall then be located within this State if the taxpayer:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(c)(i)">(i)</span> Had a regular place of business within this State at the time the loan was made; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> In the case of a loan which is assigned by the taxpayer to a place without this State which is not a regular place of business, it shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal by the taxpayer on a showing supported by the preponderance of evidence, that the preponderance of substantive contacts regarding the loan occurred within this State if, at the time the loan was made, the taxpayer's commercial domicile was within this State.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(a)">(a)</span> To determine the state in which the preponderance of substantive contacts relating to a loan have occurred, the facts and circumstances regarding the loan at issue shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and consideration shall be given to activities such as the solicitation, investigation, negotiation, approval, and administration of the loan. The terms solicitation, investigation, negotiation, approval, and administration are described in Â§G(3)(b)â(f) of this regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(b)">(b)</span> "Solicitation" is either active or passive. Active solicitation occurs when an employee of the taxpayer initiates the contact with the customer. That activity is located at the regular place of business which the taxpayer's employee is regularly connected with or working out of, regardless of where the services of the employee were actually performed. Passive solicitation occurs when the customer initiates the contact with the taxpayer. If the customer's initial contact was not at a regular place of business of the taxpayer, the regular place of business, if any, where the passive solicitation occurred is determined by the facts in each case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(c)">(c)</span> "Investigation" is the procedure whereby employees of the taxpayer determine the creditworthiness of the customer as well as the degree of risk involved in making a particular agreement. That activity is located at the regular place of business which the taxpayer's employees are regularly connected with or working out of, regardless of where the services of the employees were actually performed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(d)">(d)</span> "Negotiation" is the procedure whereby employees of the taxpayer and its customer determine the terms of the agreement such as the amount, duration, interest rate, frequency of repayment, currency denomination, and security required. That activity is located at the regular place of business which the taxpayer's employees are regularly connected with or working out of, regardless of where the services of the employees were actually performed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(e)">(e)</span> "Approval" is the procedure whereby employees or the board of directors of the taxpayer make the final determination of whether to enter into the agreement. That activity is located at the regular place of business which the taxpayer's employees are regularly connected with or working out of, regardless of where the services of the employees were actually performed. If the board of directors makes the final determination, the activity is located at the commercial domicile of the taxpayer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(f)">(f)</span> "Administration" is the process of managing the account. This process includes bookkeeping, collecting the payments, corresponding with the customer, reporting to management regarding the status of the agreement, and proceeding against the borrower or the security interest if the borrower is in default. That activity is located at the regular place of business which oversees this activity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> For purposes of determining the location of credit card receivables, credit card receivables are treated as loans and are subject to the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/03.04.08.05#G" title="">Â§G of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> A loan that has been properly assigned to a state shall, absent any change of material fact, remain assigned to that state for the length of the original term of the loan.
