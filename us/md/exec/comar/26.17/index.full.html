Failure damage potential shall consider future development and use of the area flooded throughout the danger reach and the damage which would be expected from a complete breaching of the dam. If, in the opinion of the Administration, future development is probable in the area flooded throughout the danger reach, the dam shall be classed in Category I. The classification of the proposed dam shall be assigned by the Administration after the applicant has provided information on the potential damage within the danger reach, as defined herein. After the classification has been assigned, the inflow design flood and spillway design may be established. Dams qualifying for the Category III classification may be classed in Category IV, if all of the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gen&amp;section=5-503" title="">Environment Article, §5-503(b), Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, are met with the exception of §5-503(b)(1).</p>

Adequate provision shall be made to dissipate the energy of water flowing over or through the dam and to protect the downstream toe of the dam.</p>

The design shall allow for certain freeboard as a minimum, not to be reduced under any circumstances during the operation of the dam and reservoir. The design freeboard is for that reservoir stage which will exist when the pool has reached maximum level during the inflow design flood with the outlet works and overflow spillway operating as planned. The freeboard is to be calculated to prevent overtopping and protect the dam against the destructive forces of waves, frost, settlement, and surface erosion.</p>

The Administration may include, either at the time of granting a permit for construction of a dam or at a later date, a requirement that the owner provide and install devices necessary for the future inspection and surveillance of the dam. The number, type, and location of the devices shall be determined as a result of the Administration's evaluation of the size and nature of the dam, the complexity of local natural conditions, and the degree of risk resulting from any future deterioration or failure. The requirement may include provisions for the measurement of the settlement of the crest or slopes of dams, the movement of walls in the valley or reservoir, the increases in pore-water pressure in earth or the increases in flow from drainage systems, and the installation of other devices required to detect serious changes in the structure or the affected area to allow the repair of deficiencies before more serious risk develops.</p>

To conserve and protect water resources of the State in the best interest of the people, the Department is authorized to control appropriation or use of surface and ground waters. This control provides for the greatest possible use of waters in the State, while protecting the State's valuable water supply resources from mismanagement, abuse, or overuse. The State's water supply resources include watercourses, lakes, aquifers, tidal areas, and other bodies of water in the State. Private property owners have the right to make reasonable use of the waters of the State which cross or are adjacent to their land. For the benefit of the public, the Department acts as the State's trustee of its water resources.</p>
