                <p>This chapter applies to a comprehensive induction program for new teachers. The purpose of this regulation is to provide guidance for local school systems to establish a high quality induction program that addresses critical professional learning needs of new teachers, improves instructional quality, and helps inductees achieve success in their initial assignments, resulting in improved student learning and higher retention in the profession. The induction program that each local school system designs shall reflect coherence in structure and consistency in focus to ensure an integrated, seamless system of support. Recognizing that "one-size-fits-all" induction programs do not meet the needs of new teachers, these regulations establish the components of an induction program, allowing local school systems to build on their current programs.</p>

                <p>This chapter applies to a comprehensive induction program for new principals. The purpose of this regulation is to provide guidance for local school systems to establish a high quality induction program that addresses critical professional learning needs of new principals, improves instructional quality, and helps inductees achieve success in their initial assignments, resulting in improved student learning and higher retention in the profession. The induction program that each local school system designs shall reflect coherence in structure and consistency in focus to ensure an integrated, seamless system of support. Recognizing that "one-size-fits-all" induction programs do not meet the needs of new principals, these regulations establish the components of an induction program, allowing local school systems to build on their current programs.</p>
