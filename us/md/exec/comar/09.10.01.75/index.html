                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The Super Bet is a form of pari-mutuel wagering on three designated races. The bettor selects the two horses that will finish first and second in each of the first two designated races of the Super Bet, and the three horses that will finish first, second, and third in the third designated race of the Super Bet, in each case in the exact order of finish as officially posted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> The Super Bet pool shall be held entirely separate from all other pools, and may not be part of any exacta, triple, daily double, or other wagering pool. The Super Bet is not a parlay.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Repealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> The three races which comprise the Super Bet shall be approved by the Commission and clearly designated in the program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Super Bet tickets shall be clearly identified as such, so as to distinguish them from tickets on other wagering pools.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Coupled entries and fields are prohibited in the three designated Super Bet races.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> If a dead heat or dead heats occur in any of the races of the Super Bet, all Super Bet tickets selecting the correct order of finish counting a horse in a dead heat as finishing in any position dead heated shall be winning tickets, and contrary to the usual practice, the aggregate winning tickets shall be divided into the net pool and be paid the same pay-off price.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Wagering for the Super Bet shall close at the same time that wagering is closed on the first designated race of the Super Bet. If a horse is scratched in a designated race of the Super Bet while wagering on the Super Bet is still open, wagers containing the scratched horse will be deducted from the Super Bet pool and will be refunded just as in other types of wagers. After the close of wagering on the Super Bet, if a horse has been scratched, a consolation pool, or pools, will be established in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/09.10.01.75#P" title="">§P of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> If for any reason, including but not limited to, weather conditions, less than all of the designated races of the Super Bet are cancelled or are not declared "official," then all horses in the cancelled race or races that were selected on Super Bet tickets shall be considered winners for purposes of the Super Bet. If for any reason all of the designated races of the Super Bet are cancelled, then all pari-mutuel tickets that were issued for that performance shall be refunded and the Super Bet shall be cancelled for that performance. In all the above instances, any contributions to the Super Bet pool from prior performances will be carried over and included in the Super Bet pool for the next performance as prescribed in §J, below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> If there is no Super Bet ticket issued accurately selecting the officially declared winning combination in the exact order of finish in each of the three designated races of the Super Bet, then the net pool (the amount wagered less all applicable commissions and taxes under the laws of this State) shall be carried over and included with the net Super Bet pool at the next performance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> If the accumulated carry-over pool of the Super Bet has not been distributed before the closing day of the meeting in which the pool was generated, or if the Association invokes the provisions of §L, the net amount of the carry-over pool so remaining shall be distributed even if a Super Bet ticket is not a winning ticket under §A. In this event, the winning tickets shall be those combining on that performance the most consecutive finishers in the winning combination, starting with the winner of the first designated race of the Super Bet (for example, if the exact winning combination is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3, and the best ticket sold is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-ALL). If there is a cancellation of the closing day's performance, the accumulated carry-over pool shall be carried over to the Thoroughbred Association next to operate that accepts Super Bet wagering. If the Thoroughbred Association next to operate does not accept Super Bet wagering, the accumulated carry-over pool shall be deposited in a Maryland bank, in interest bearing form, and the accumulated pool together with all interest earned on it shall be carried over to the first day of the next racing meeting of the Thoroughbred Association accepting Super Bet wagering.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> The Association accepting Super Bet wagering may elect, if there is an undistributed accumulated carry-over pool of the Super Bet, to declare a mandatory Super Bet distribution, provided it makes an announcement of its intention to do so at least 24 hours before the opening of Super Bet wagering for that performance. In this event, all of the Super Bet carry-over pool shall be distributed on this performance, even if a Super Bet ticket is not a winning ticket under §A, in accordance with the provisions for determining a winning ticket under §K.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> The Association may elect to guarantee a gross Super Bet (the accumulated carry-over pool plus gross Super Bet wagering on the current performance) by adding any shortfall from this guarantee to the accumulated carry-over pool, provided it makes announcement of its intention to do so before the opening of Super Bet wagering for that performance. Commissions or taxes may not be deducted from the added amount.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N">N.</span> Sales of Super Bet tickets other than from pari-mutuel machines shall be deemed illegal and prohibited. Resale of Super Bet tickets from one individual to another is prohibited and shall be grounds for ejection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O">O.</span> The acceptance of the Super Bet ticket by an individual taking an issued ticket away from the windows of the terminal from which it was issued shall constitute an acknowledgement by the bettor of the correctness of the ticket. Each purchaser of a Super Bet ticket agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of this and all other applicable Commission regulations and by the laws of the State pertaining to pari-mutuel wagering. The Association, totalisator, and the State may not be liable to any person for a Super Bet ticket which is not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O(1)">(1)</span> A winning ticket in accordance with the provisions of this regulation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O(2)">(2)</span> Delivered for any reason, including but not limited to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="O(2)(a)">(a)</span> Mechanical malfunction,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="O(2)(b)">(b)</span> Electrical failure,</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(1)">(1)</span> If one or more horses are scratched (scratches) after the close of wagering on the designated races of the Super Bet, consolation pools shall be established.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(2)">(2)</span> Consolation pools shall consist of the amount wagered on all combinations that contain the "scratches" after the deduction of all applicable commissions and taxes under the laws of this State from these wagers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(3)">(3)</span> Wagers. The relationship that the above amount bears to todays net pool, before the deduction of the above amount from todays net pool, will be the relationship that it will bear to the pool carried forward to this performance (carry-over pool) for the purposes of distributing that portion of the "carry-over pool" to the holder of a winning wager as determined in §P(4), below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="P(4)">(4)</span> A Super Bet wager which contains "scratches" shall participate in the consolation pool if the wager contains all other horses in the correct order of finish except the "scratches," or, if the "scratches" are in a superior position to the other horses selected, the other horses finish in the next most superior position vacated by the "scratches" or the next most superior position of any horse so advanced. For example, if the exact winning combination is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3, and the 4 horse was scratched in the third race of the Super Bet a wager of 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-4 would qualify as a winning consolation wager as well as a wager of 1-2, 1-2, 4-1-2 or 1-2, 1-4-2. No other combination would be a winning wager in this example. If there is no winning wager of the consolation pool, the amounts in the consolation pool shall be returned to the pools from which they were deducted before distribution from these pools. If §K or L of this regulation are invoked, the consolation provision of this section shall apply to §§K and L as well.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Q">Q.</span> This regulation shall be prominently displayed in the betting area of each Association conducting a Super Bet program.</p>
