                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> During the PAL effective period, emission reductions of a PAL pollutant may not be creditable for use as ERCs unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of the reduction and the reduction would be creditable in the absence of the PAL.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)">(6)</span> PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a public participation procedure that is consistent with 40 CFR §§51.160 and 51.161. The Department shall provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day period for submittal of public comment. All comments received by the Department shall be addressed before the Department takes final action on the permit.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Any PAL that is not renewed according to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.08#G" title="">§G of this regulation</a> shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals, the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if this distribution is more appropriate, as determined by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for any applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.08#G" title="">§G of this regulation</a>, the distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> Each emissions unit shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a 12-month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (for example, source testing or emission factors) other than CEMs, CERMs, PEMs, or CPMs to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(5)">(5)</span> Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide, multi-unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(6)">(6)</span> Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source is subject to the nonattainment major NSR requirements if the change meets the definition of a major modification.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(7)">(7)</span> The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or before the PAL effective period, except for those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.02#G" title="">Regulation .02G of this chapter</a> but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.07#A(2)(c)" title="">Regulation .07A(2)(c) of this chapter</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> A person who requests renewal of a PAL permit shall apply for the renewal not later than 6 months before the existing PAL permit expiration date. If a person submits a complete application to renew the PAL within that time period, the PAL shall continue to be effective until a renewed permit is issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> The application to renew the PAL shall contain the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(a)">(a)</span> The information required in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.08#A" title="">§A of this regulation</a>;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)(d)">(d)</span> Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> Adjustments at Renewal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(a)">(a)</span> If the sum of the emissions from each emissions unit within the PAL is 80 percent or less than the PAL, a renewed PAL permit may be issued at the same level.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(b)">(b)</span> The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(c)">(c)</span> If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level not greater than the potential to emit of the source, and the Department may not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.09#A" title="">Regulation .09A of this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> If a compliance date for a State or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for this requirement, that PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(5)">(5)</span> The Department shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During the public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)">(1)</span> Requirements for Increasing a PAL.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(a)">(a)</span> A PAL may be increased during the PAL effective period if the requirements of this subsection are met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(b)">(b)</span> The owner or operator of the major stationary source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. The application shall identify the emissions units contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(c)">(c)</span> As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions units, exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding 10 years. In this case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit shall currently comply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(d)">(d)</span> The owner or operator shall obtain a major NSR permit for all emissions units identified in this subsection regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions units shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the nonattainment major NSR program processed (for example, LAER), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)(e)">(e)</span> The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(2)">(2)</span> The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.08#H(1)(c)" title="">§H(1)(c) of this regulation</a>), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(3)">(3)</span> The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.11.17.08#D(6)" title="">§D(6) of this regulation</a>.</p>
