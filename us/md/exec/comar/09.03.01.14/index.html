                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Classification of Problem Business Loans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Business Loan Categories.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(a)">(a)</span> A business loan may be classified by credit union management or the Commissioner into one or more of the categories described in this subsection upon a regular review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(b)">(b)</span> Substandard. A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the value of any collateral pledged. Loans classified as substandard have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the credit union will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual loans classified substandard.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(c)">(c)</span> Doubtful. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may strengthen the loan, its classification as an estimated loss may be deferred or limited until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation actions, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)(d)">(d)</span> Loss. A loan classified as loss is considered uncollectable and of such little value that its continuance as a loan on the books of a credit union is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may occur in the future.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Allowance for Loan Losses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(a)">(a)</span> The determination whether a member business loan will be classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss for purposes of the valuation allowance for loan losses, will be based on factors not limited to the delinquency of the loan, including, but not limited to, the adequacy of analysis and documentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)">(b)</span> An allowance for loan losses shall be maintained for the specified classified loans as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Loss loans at 100 percent of outstanding balance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Doubtful loans at 50 percent of outstanding balance; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> Substandard loans at 10 percent of outstanding balance unless other factors (for example, history of these loans at the credit union) indicate a greater or lesser amount is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Restrictions on Member Business Loans to Officials, Senior Management Employees, and Their Family Members.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> A credit union may make member business loans to officials, senior management employees, and their family members subject to the following restrictions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(a)">(a)</span> The official, senior management employee, or their family member who will receive the proceeds of a member business loan may take no part in the decision-making process for approval of the loan;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(b)">(b)</span> All member business loans to officials, senior management employees, or their family members that, when added to the aggregate of all other credit union loans for which the official, senior management employee, or their family member is a debtor, guarantor, endorser, or cosigner, are in excess of $25,000 shall be approved by the board; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(c)">(c)</span> The rates, terms, and conditions for any member business loan for which an official, senior management employee, or their family member is a debtor, guarantor, endorser, or cosigner may not be more favorable than the rates, terms, and conditions for a comparable loan to another member of the credit union.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> Equity Agreements/Joint Ventures. A credit union may not grant a member business loan if a portion of the amount of income to be received by the credit union, officials, senior management employees, or their family members is tied to the profit or sale of the business or commercial endeavor for which the loan is made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Records Requirements. Aggregate member business loans shall be identified on the credit union's financial statements and each category of member business loan shall be separately identified in the credit union's records.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Waiver of Limits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> A credit union may request a waiver of certain limits as listed in this regulation as follows:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> If the credit union's policies or practices violate safe and sound lending principles, the Commissioner may restrict all limits as listed in this chapter or revoke the credit union's approval to make member business loans.</p>
