Each group health insurance contract shall contain a provision that requires the employer, labor union, association, or other entity to which a contract of group health insurance has been issued to continue to pay the premium for an employee, member, or dependent under the policy until notice of termination of coverage has been received by the carrier.</p>
                <p>Agency Note: Section M of this regulation is intended to implement the standard provision required by <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=15-303" title="">Insurance Article, §15-303(f), Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, which was enacted as part of Chapter 554, Acts of 1999 (SB 350). The Attorney General approved the enactment for constitutionality and legal sufficiency, but determined that the standard provision requiring employers, labor unions, associations, and other purchasers of group insurance to notify insurers immediately on termination of an individual insured or continue to pay premiums after coverage has ceased, was likely preempted by the federal Employees' Retirement Security Act (ERISA).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(1)">(1)</span> Each group health insurance contract shall specify the premium due date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(2)">(2)</span> The premium due date shall be the date the coverage period begins.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(3)">(3)</span> A carrier may offer each group policyholder the option to pay the premium through an electronic payment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N(4)">(4)</span> If the group policyholder elects an electronic payment, the carrier may not debit or charge the amount of the premium due prior to the premium due date, except as authorized by the group policyholder.</p>
