                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> Classification of Dams. The following table sets forth judgmental factors for minimizing the risk associated with the design of dams. The table is intended only as a guide. A proposed dam shall satisfy all four factors (normal pool storage volume, normal depth, potential for loss of life, and potential for damage) in order to avoid classification in a more rigorous category. Failure damage potential shall consider future development and use of the area flooded throughout the danger reach and the damage which would be expected from a complete breaching of the dam. If, in the opinion of the Administration, future development is probable in the area flooded throughout the danger reach, the dam shall be classed in Category I. The classification of the proposed dam shall be assigned by the Administration after the applicant has provided information on the potential damage within the danger reach, as defined herein. After the classification has been assigned, the inflow design flood and spillway design may be established. Dams qualifying for the Category III classification may be classed in Category IV, if all of the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gen&amp;section=5-503" title="">Environment Article, §5-503(b), Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, are met with the exception of §5-503(b)(1).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1">*Category IV is reserved for those structures which have a contributing drainage area of less than 1 square mile (640 acres), and a normal depth of water less than 15 feet above the original stream bed, and a normal surface area less than 12 acres.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> Danger Reach. A danger reach shall be established for all proposed dams by routing a flood hydrograph resulting from a failure of the structure. Computation of the danger reach is an iterative process and, based upon the potential for damage and loss of life, may necessitate reclassification to a higher category by the Administration. The danger reach shall be established using methods that compare the depth and aerial extent of the flood waters without and with the proposed dam as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> The inflow design flood shall be flood routed throughout the downstream valley without the proposed dam in place.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> A dam-breach flood wave shall be routed throughout the downstream valley assuming failure of the dam. The following procedures are incorporated by reference and shall be considered acceptable by the Administration:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> Under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.17.04.05#B(2)(b)" title="">§B(2)(b) of this regulation</a>, consideration shall also be given to the peak discharge caused by the design storms in the uncontrolled area below the dam, together with the flow over and through the dam.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> Inflow Design Flood. The inflow design flood for Category I dams shall be the probable maximum flood. For Category II dams the inflow design flood shall be the standard project flood or the largest flood of record, whichever is greater. For Category III dams the inflow design flood shall be one having a recurrence interval of once in 100 years or longer. For Category IV dams the inflow design flood shall be as defined in USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Maryland Conservation Practice, Standard Pond Code 378 (January, 2000), which is incorporated by reference in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.17.02.01" title=".01 Purpose and Scope.">COMAR 26.17.02.01</a>-1B(2). Criteria shall be provided or approved by the Administration for each of the above inflow design floods.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> Spillway Design. Established procedures for spillway design and capacity, when properly applied, will be accepted by the Administration. The effects of storage may be taken into account in establishing spillway capacity and top of dam. All spillways shall be designed to adequately handle debris either by trash racks or with sufficient opening. All dams shall have an overflow spillway included in the design. A constructed earthen embankment may not be used as an overflow spillway. All dams classed in Category I or II shall be designed with an emergency spillway which passes the inflow design flood without endangering the dam and whose predicted frequency of use is not greater than once in 100 years. Adequate provision shall be made to dissipate the energy of water flowing over or through the dam and to protect the downstream toe of the dam.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> Dams in Category IV. The designs, plans, and specifications for all dams classed in Category IV, and not approved by either the soil conservation district or the Administration’s designee, shall be reviewed by the Administration for technical compliance with the requirements in USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Maryland Conservation Practice, Standard Pond Code 378 (January, 2000), which is incorporated by reference in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.17.02.01" title=".01 Purpose and Scope.">COMAR 26.17.02.01</a>-1B(2), and the Administration’s policies and procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Design Specifications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Design References. References used by the designer shall be cited in the application submitted to the Administration, especially where unusual features are incorporated in the design.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Freeboard. The design shall allow for certain freeboard as a minimum, not to be reduced under any circumstances during the operation of the dam and reservoir. The design freeboard is for that reservoir stage which will exist when the pool has reached maximum level during the inflow design flood with the outlet works and overflow spillway operating as planned. The freeboard is to be calculated to prevent overtopping and protect the dam against the destructive forces of waves, frost, settlement, and surface erosion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(3)">(3)</span> Safety Factor. The safety factor shall be that used in good engineering practice in dam design. In all important structural features, the safety factor used shall be shown in the design assumptions. The Administration requires a safety factor of at least 1.5 to be included in the structural design of the dam or any of its components during steady state seepage conditions, and at least 1.2 during rapid drawdown of the reservoir pool from the spillway crest. If site conditions or the downstream hazard category warrants, the Administration may require a safety factor of greater than specified in this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)">(4)</span> Drains. Dams shall include a device to allow draining of the reservoir within a reasonable amount of time. The following factors shall be considered in determining the reasonable time period for drainage:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(a)">(a)</span> The risk and nature of a potential dam failure;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(b)">(b)</span> The time likely to be available to avert a failure after notice of conditions threatening the safety or stability of the dam; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C(4)(c)">(c)</span> The influence of rapid drawdown on the stability of the dam, its appurtenant works, and the natural upstream slopes of the reservoir.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(5)">(5)</span> Specifications. Specifications shall be written to assure that design criteria, with regard to the quality of the materials and methods of construction, will be met or exceeded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(6)">(6)</span> Providing Means for Inspections. The Administration may include, either at the time of granting a permit for construction of a dam or at a later date, a requirement that the owner provide and install devices necessary for the future inspection and surveillance of the dam. The number, type, and location of the devices shall be determined as a result of the Administration's evaluation of the size and nature of the dam, the complexity of local natural conditions, and the degree of risk resulting from any future deterioration or failure. The requirement may include provisions for the measurement of the settlement of the crest or slopes of dams, the movement of walls in the valley or reservoir, the increases in pore-water pressure in earth or the increases in flow from drainage systems, and the installation of other devices required to detect serious changes in the structure or the affected area to allow the repair of deficiencies before more serious risk develops.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(7)">(7)</span> Multiple Dams. When dams are spaced so that the failure of an upstream dam or structure could endanger the safety of one downstream, the possibility of a multiple failure shall be considered in reviewing the design. Additional safety shall be provided in either structure by increasing the retarding storage or increasing the emergency spillway capacity, or both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Construction Requirements.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Surveillance and Inspection of Completed Dams and Reservoirs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Responsibility for Inspections by Owner. The owner is responsible for the safety of the dam and for the necessary surveillance and inspections. The surveillance shall be performed by the owner, or a representative of the owner, and shall provide a close watch on the conditions affecting the dam's safety. The owner shall promptly notify the Administration of significant changes in condition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Responsibility for Inspections by Administration. In addition to the inspections by the owner, the Administration shall make inspections of all dams, reservoirs, and other waterway obstructions within its jurisdiction to provide for the public safety and welfare, to detect early signs of deterioration, and to enforce corrective measures. The Administration's agents shall be given free access to every part of the dam or reservoir under consideration, and the operators of these works shall assist in the inspection to the best of their abilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Repair of Dams. Before beginning the repair of any dam or reservoir, the owner shall apply for, in writing, and secure the Administration's written approval of the contemplated action. The application shall give the name and address of the applicant, details of the proposed changes, referenced to the existing structure, and shall be accompanied by the necessary plans and specifications.
