                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> Application forms shall include the following questions designed to elicit information as to whether, as of the date of the application, the applicant currently has Medicare supplement, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid coverage, or another health insurance policy or certificate in force or whether a Medicare supplement policy or certificate is intended to replace any other accident and sickness policy or certificate presently in force.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> A supplementary application or other form to be signed by the applicant and insurance producer containing these questions and statements may be used.</p>
                <p class="center ">{Statements}</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> You do not need more than one Medicare supplement policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> If you purchase this policy, you may want to evaluate your existing health coverage and decide if you need multiple coverages.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> You may be eligible for benefits under Medicaid and may not need a Medicare supplement policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> If, after purchasing this policy, you become eligible for Medicaid, the benefits and premiums under your Medicare supplement policy can be suspended, if requested, during your entitlement to benefits under Medicaid for 24 months. You must request this suspension within 90 days of becoming eligible for Medicaid. If you are no longer entitled to Medicaid, your suspended Medicare supplement policy (or, if that is no longer available, a substantially equivalent policy) will be reinstituted if requested within 90 days of losing Medicaid eligibility. If the Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and you enrolled in Medicare Part D while your policy was suspended, the reinstituted policy will not have outpatient prescription drug coverage, but will otherwise be substantially equivalent to your coverage before the date of the suspension.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(5)">(5)</span> If you are eligible for, and have enrolled in a Medicare supplement policy by reason of disability and you later become covered by an employer or union-based group health plan, the benefits and premiums under your Medicare supplement policy can be suspended, if requested, while you are covered under the employer or union-based group health plan. If you suspend your Medicare supplement policy under these circumstances, and later lose your employer or union-based group health plan, your suspended Medicare supplement policy (or, if that is no longer available, a substantially equivalent policy) will be reinstituted if requested within 90 days of losing your employer or union-based group health plan. If the Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and you enrolled in Medicare Part D while your policy was suspended, the reinstituted policy will not have outpatient prescription drug coverage, but will otherwise be substantially equivalent to your coverage before the date of the suspension.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(6)">(6)</span> Counseling services may be available in your state to provide advice concerning your purchase of Medicare supplement insurance and concerning medical assistance through the State Medicaid program, including benefits as a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and a Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB).</p>

                <p class="center ">NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE</p>
                <p class="center ">(Insurance company's name and address)</p>
                <p class="center ">SAVE THIS NOTICE! IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN THE FUTURE.</p>
                <p>According to (your application) (information you have furnished), you intend to terminate existing Medicare supplement or Medicare Advantage insurance and replace it with a policy to be issued by (Company Name) Insurance Company. Your new policy will provide thirty (30) days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the policy.</p>
                <p>You should review this new coverage carefully. Compare it with all accident and sickness coverage you now have. If, after due consideration, you find that purchase of this Medicare supplement coverage is a wise decision, you should terminate your present Medicare supplement or Medicare Advantage coverage. You should evaluate the need for other accident and sickness coverage you have that may duplicate this policy.</p>
                <p class="center ">STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY ISSUER, AGENT {BROKER OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE}:</p>
                <p>I have reviewed your current medical or health insurance coverage. To the best of my knowledge, this Medicare supplement policy will not duplicate your existing Medicare supplement or, if applicable, Medicare Advantage coverage because you intend to terminate your existing Medicare supplement coverage or leave your Medicare Advantage plan. The replacement policy is being purchased for the following reason (check one):</p>
                <p>____ Additional benefits.</p>
                <p>____ No change in benefits, but lower premiums.</p>
                <p>____ Fewer benefits and lower premiums.</p>
                <p>____ My plan has outpatient prescription drug coverage and I am enrolling in Part D.</p>
                <p>____ Disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. Please explain reason for disenrollment (optional only for Direct Mailers)</p>
                <p>______________________________________________________</p>
                <p>____ Other (please specify)</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E1">1.</span> Note: If the issuer of the Medicare supplement policy being applied for does not, or is otherwise prohibited from imposing preexisting condition limitations, please skip to statement 2 below. Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting conditions) may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E2">2.</span> State law provides your replacement policy or certificate may not contain new preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods. The insurer will waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or probationary periods in the new policy (or coverage) for similar benefits to the extent such time was spent (depleted) under the original policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E3">3.</span> If you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer all questions on the application concerning your medical and health history. Failure to include all material medical information on an application may provide a basis for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, review it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded. (If the policy or certificate is guaranteed issue, this paragraph need not appear.)</p>
                <p>Do not cancel your present policy until you have received your new policy and are sure that you want to keep it.</p>
