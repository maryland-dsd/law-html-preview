                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> A waste pile except for an existing portion of a waste pile, shall have:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> A liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the pile into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the waste pile. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow waste to migrate into the liner itself (but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water) during the active life of the facility. The liner shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste or leachate.</p>

The Secretary will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (1 foot). The leachate collection and removal system shall be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)(i)">(i)</span> Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the pile and the leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under pressures exerted by overlaying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used at the pile; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the waste pile.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The owner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of §B(1) if the Secretary finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternate design and operating practices together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see Regulation .06-1B of this chapter) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the Secretary shall consider:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> The nature and quantity of the wastes;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> The proposed alternate design and operation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(c)">(c)</span> The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including attenuative capacity and thickness of the liners and soils present between the pile and ground water or surface water; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(d)">(d)</span> All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> The owner or operator shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)">(a)</span> Install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between these liners for each:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(i)">(i)</span> New waste pile unit;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> Lateral expansion of a waste pile unit; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> Replacement of an existing waste pile unit; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)(b)">(b)</span> Ensure that the liners and leachate collection and removal system meet the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.12#D" title="">§D of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(4)">(4)</span> The owner or operator shall design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-on control system capable of preventing flow onto the active portion of the pile during peak discharge from at least a 25-year storm.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> The owner or operator shall design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-off management system to collect and control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(6)">(6)</span> Collection and holding facilities (for example, tanks or basins) associated with run-on and run-off control systems shall be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously after storms to maintain design capacity of the system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(7)">(7)</span> If the pile contains any particulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the owner or operator shall cover or otherwise manage the pile to control wind dispersal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(8)">(8)</span> The Secretary shall specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Waste Analysis. In addition to the waste analysis required by Regulation .02D, of this chapter, the owner or operator shall analyze a representative sample of waste from each incoming movement before adding the waste to any existing pile, unless the only wastes the facility receives which are amenable to piling are compatible with each other, or the waste received is compatible with the waste in the pile to which it is to be added. This analysis conducted shall be capable of differentiating between the types of hazardous waste the owner or operator places in piles, so that mixing of incompatible waste does not inadvertently occur. The analysis shall include a visual comparison of color and texture.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Containment Systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> Except as provided in §D(2) and (3) of this regulation, the owner or operator shall ensure that a waste pile subject to this regulation includes a containment system that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(a)">(a)</span> Incorporates two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between the liners, with the leachate collection and removal system also serving as a leak detection system; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)(b)">(b)</span> Is designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR §264.251(c)(1)—(5), except that, in meeting these requirements, the owner or operator shall substitute “Secretary” for “Regional Administrator”.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> The Secretary may approve alternative designs and operating practices to those specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.12#D(1)" title="">§D(1) of this regulation</a> if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Secretary that the proposed designs and operating practices, together with location characteristics, will:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(a)">(a)</span> Prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection and removal systems specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.12#D(1)" title="">§D(1) of this regulation</a>; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)">(b)</span> Allow detection of leaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as effectively as the design and operating practices specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.12#D(1)" title="">§D(1) of this regulation</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> The requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.12#D(1)(a)" title="">§D(1)(a) of this regulation</a> do not apply to a monofil that has been granted a waiver by the Secretary in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.11#D(6)" title="">Regulation .11D(6) of this chapter</a>.</p>
