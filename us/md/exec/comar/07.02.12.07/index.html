                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> A post adoption assistance payment shall be determined through negotiation and agreement between a local department and the adoptive parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> The post adoption assistance payment may combine with the parent’s financial resources to assist with meeting the child’s identifiable, quantifiable current and future needs.</p>
