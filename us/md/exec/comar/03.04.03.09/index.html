                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)">(b)</span> The amount paid to a corporation for providing the services of an actor or director who is an employee of the corporation, or for loaning the services of an actor or director who is under contract with the corporation, is, if substantial, included in the producer's payroll factor as if the amount paid was compensation paid to an employee of the producer.</p>
