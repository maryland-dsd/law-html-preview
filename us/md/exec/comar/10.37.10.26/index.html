                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(a)">(a)</span> A third-party payer that provides current financing equal to the average amount of outstanding charges for bills from the end of each regular billing period and for discharged patients shall be entitled to a 2-percent discount. For purposes of this regulation, a regular billing period shall be based on a 30-day billing cycle. The current financing provided in here corresponds to a third party's paying on discharge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(b)">(b)</span> A third-party payer that provides current financing equal to the average amount of outstanding charges for discharged patients plus the average daily charges times the average length of stay, shall be entitled to a 2.25-percent discount. The current financing provided in here corresponds to a third party's paying on admission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(c)">(c)</span> Outstanding charges shall be calculated by an amount equal to the hospital’s current average daily payment by the payer, multiplied by the hospital’s and third party payer’s processing and payment time.

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(d)">(d)</span> Upon request from an applicant, the Commission may approve an alternative method of calculating current financing monies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)(e)">(e)</span> The third-party payer shall adjust the current financing advance to reflect Commission rate orders and changes in volume associated with the particular payer and hospital. This adjustment shall be made within 45 days of a rate order or at such other time as circumstances warrant. In the absence of a rate order, the adjustment shall be made at least annually.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The third-party payer shall promptly provide the Commission with a verified record of the detailed calculation of the current financing and of each recalculated balance as adjustments are made. The detailed calculations shall become a part of the public record. The Commission may, at any time, evaluate the amount of current financing monies provided to a hospital to assure that it meets the discount of requirements specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.37.10.26#B(1)" title="">§B(1) of this regulation</a>. If the Commission finds that the amount of current financing is inconsistent with the requirements of §B(1), the Commission may, at its sole discretion, require an adjustment to the working capital advance or to the discount.</p>

Payment within 30 days of the earlier of the end of each regular billing period or discharge entitles a payer or self-pay patient to a 1-percent discount. For those payers not subject to <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=15-1005" title="">Insurance Article, §15-1005, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, after 60 days from the date of the earlier of the end of each regular billing period or discharge, interest or late payment charges may accrue on any unpaid charges at a simple rate of 1 percent per month.
