                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)(e)(ii)">(ii)</span> The condition of unemployment is met when the parent is employed less than 100 hours per month; or is employed 100 hours or more per month, if the parent's work is intermittent and the excess hours are of a temporary nature, as evidenced by the fact that the work hours were under the standard for the two previous months and are expected to be under the standard during the next month.</p>
