                <p>The regulations in this subtitle contain requirements applicable to all surface mining of coal in the State, and the surface effects of deep mining of coal. The regulations are promulgated in accordance with the Maryland Strip Mining Program pursuant to the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-87). Regulations become effective on the date of approval of the Maryland program by the Federal Office of Surface Mining or such later date as specified in the order of the Circuit Court for Allegany County in No. 35343, Equity.</p>

The purpose of this regulation is to provide requirements for the permitting of surface coal mining and reclamation operations that encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices, or allow postmining land use for industrial, commercial, residential, or public use (including recreational facilities) on an experimental basis. "Experimental practice" means the use of alternative surface coal mining and reclamation operation practices for experimental or research purposes. Experimental practices need not comply with specific environmental protection performance standards of the Regulatory Program, if approved pursuant to this regulation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/26.20.35.12#B">B.</span> Each matter of which an admission is requested is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or such shorter or longer time as the hearing officer may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party:</p>

Unless the hearing officer determines that an objection is justified, he shall order that an answer be served. If the hearing officer determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this regulation, he may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The hearing officer may, in place of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a prehearing conference or at a designated time before hearing.</p>
