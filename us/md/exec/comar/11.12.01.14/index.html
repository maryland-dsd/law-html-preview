                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(1)">(1)</span> A dealer may not advertise in any manner that is false, deceptive, or misleading or that misrepresents any vehicle offered for sale.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(2)">(2)</span> Advertisements for the sale of new and used vehicles shall clearly and conspicuously identify the dealership by the corporate name or trade name as it appears on the application for dealer’s license.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(3)">(3)</span> Advertising statements shall clearly identify the vehicle by manufacturer-designated year, make and model, type, equipment, price, trade-in allowance, terms or other claims. Terms or claims shall be factual and presented clearly and conspicuously.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A(4)">(4)</span> The use of layout, headlines, illustrations, style, sound, length of time, lighting, color, or type of size of an advertisement, or all of the above, may not obscure or make misleading any material fact in advertisement or sales presentation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> Price and Vehicle Identification.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(1)">(1)</span> When the price of a vehicle is quoted, the advertisement shall clearly identify the vehicle as to, including but not limited to, make, year, model and special equipment. A price may not be quoted unless the vehicle or vehicles identified in the advertisement are currently available for sale to the public at the quoted price.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)">(2)</span> The advertised price shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(a)">(a)</span> Be the full delivered cash price, which the customer shall pay, except for taxes and title fees; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B(2)(b)">(b)</span> In the case of new vehicles, include any dealer processing charge and freight charge, unless the dealer clearly and conspicuously discloses the amount of these charges in the advertisement as required by <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gtr&amp;section=15-311" title="">Transportation Article, §15-311</a>.1, Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(3)">(3)</span> Freight and dealer preparation charges may be excluded from manufacturer’s national advertising campaigns. However, the advertisement shall clearly and conspicuously disclose this fact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Comparative Price and Savings Claims.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(1)">(1)</span> Retail advertising may not imply that the dealer has a special relationship or connection to the manufacturer that other dealers do not have. Terms such as “wholesale”, “factory sale”, “factory discount”, “factory outlet”, “factory branch”, and similar terms used in connection with the manufacturer’s name (such as “manufacturer’s outlet”) are examples of terms that imply that a dealer has a special relationship or connection to a manufacturer that other dealers do not have.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C(2)">(2)</span> Statements such as “as low as”, “from”, or “priced from” may not be used in connection with the purchase price unless at least one vehicle is specifically identified and the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/11.12.01.14#B" title="">§B of this regulation</a> are complied with.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Advertising, Shipping, and Selling Practices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(1)">(1)</span> A vehicle offered for sale as consumer goods at a specific price by a dealer shall be in the possession of the dealer advertiser or be available for shipment to the dealer from the manufacturer or distributor. The vehicle shall be shown, demonstrated, and sold, or if a new vehicle, orders shall be taken for future delivery of the identical model at the advertised price and terms. If the advertised vehicle is a used vehicle, and it has been sold as consumer goods, the dealer advertiser shall substantiate, upon request, sales records of the previously advertised vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)">(2)</span> A dealer offering a vehicle for sale as consumer goods may not charge the customer a fee for shipment of a used vehicle that is not available on the premises unless the shipping fee is clearly and conspicuously disclosed on a separate form entitled ‘Payment of a Non-Refundable Shipping Fee’, before the customer becomes obligated to pay the fee, on a form with signature of the customer using the language, “I UNDERSTAND THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT ON THE PREMISES AT THIS DEALER LOCATION AND WILL HAVE TO BE SHIPPED FROM ANOTHER LOCATION.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW IN ITEMS (A) THROUGH (D), I AGREE TO PAY THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT (INSERT SPECIFIED FEE), NOT TO EXCEED THE ACTUAL AMOUNT INCURRED BY THE DEALERSHIP AS A SHIPPING FEE, WHETHER OR NOT I AGREE TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS FEE IN NO WAY OBLIGATES ME TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE UPON DELIVERY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS FEE IS REFUNDABLE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LISTED BELOW:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(a)">(a)</span> The Vehicle is materially different than advertised;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(b)">(b)</span> The vehicle contains undisclosed cosmetic damage or mechanical deficiency that the seller will not repair at the seller’s expense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(c)">(c)</span> The vehicle contains undisclosed cosmetic damage or mechanical deficiency to the extent that it impacts the retail value classification of the vehicle prior to repairs being made as determined by referencing a nationally recognized vehicle value guide irrespective of the seller making repairs at the seller’s expense; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(2)(d)">(d)</span> The vehicle or delivery violates any other provision of federal or state law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(3)">(3)</span> Nothing in this section precludes the fee being financed with the sale of the vehicle if the customer elects to purchase the vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(4)">(4)</span> Payment of the shipping fee does not obligate the customer to accept and purchase the vehicle in any way.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)">(5)</span> The shipping fee must be refunded if the vehicle:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(a)">(a)</span> Is materially different than advertised;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(b)">(b)</span> Contains undisclosed cosmetic damage or a mechanical deficiency that the seller will not repair at the seller’s expense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(c)">(c)</span> Contains undisclosed cosmetic damage or a mechanical deficiency to the extent that it impacts the retail value classification of the vehicle prior to repairs being made as determined by referencing a nationally recognized vehicle value guide irrespective of the seller making repairs at the seller’s expense; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D(5)(d)">(d)</span> The vehicle or delivery violates any other provision of federal or State law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(6)">(6)</span> The dealer shall inform the customer of the right to make a complaint with the Administration through use of the Investigative Decision Complaint Form if the customer elects not to purchase the vehicle or returns the vehicle and disagrees with a decision to not issue a refund for shipping charges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(7)">(7)</span> The practice of increasing the selling price of a vehicle above that originally quoted to a purchaser, after the purchaser has made an initial deposit or payment, either with money or with a trade-in, or signed contract is prohibited, unless the price is increased by the manufacturer. In this case, the dealer shall substantiate, upon request, evidence of the increase, and the customer shall have the right to cancel the contract.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(8)">(8)</span> Advertising a vehicle at a price which does not include equipment with which it is fitted or is ordinarily fitted or eliminating any equipment for the purpose of advertising a low price and baiting the customer into charges above the advertised price is prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(9)">(9)</span> Advertising the immediate availability of a new vehicle with the intent not to supply reasonable expectable public demand is prohibited unless the advertisement discloses a specific limitation of quantity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(10)">(10)</span> Advertising a sale or promotion in connection with the sale of a vehicle shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the expiration date, if any, and any other conditions of the sale or promotion, including but not limited to whether the supply is limited and, if so, in what manner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(11)">(11)</span> The advertising of a specific vehicle offered for sale when the advertised vehicle is not in stock on the date of the advertisement is prohibited unless the advertisement states “Not in Stock” or “Order Yours Now” or other phrases of similar import which clearly indicate that the vehicle is not available for immediate delivery and a reasonable estimate of the period of time in which delivery will be made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D(12)">(12)</span> A dealer is not obligated to refund the shipping fee if the vehicle has been accepted by the customer and the customer has not revoked acceptance within a reasonable period of time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> Down Payments, Credit Terms.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> The amount of the down payment, or the balance after the down payment, may not be stated in such a manner as to permit the impression that it is the selling price of the vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> The statement “no money down”, or other similar phrases, means that the advertiser will deliver the vehicle, so described, to the purchaser without any initial payment or other initial obligation in any manner other than negotiating a lien contract for the advertised purchase price.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> The phrases “no finance charge”, “no carrying charge”, or expressions of similar phrases, may not be used when there is any type of a charge for financed transactions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> Advertising shall comply with Regulation Z of the Federal Truth in Lending Act and Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(5)">(5)</span> Advertisements which offer special annual percentage rate financing shall disclose any special conditions or terms which shall be met before the annual percentage rate applies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> Discounts, Savings, Rebates, Trade-In Allowances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Advertisement statements which offer discounts, savings, rebates, and guaranteed trades shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(a)">(a)</span> Include the original price as well as the full delivered cash price, which the customer shall pay, except for taxes and title fees; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)(b)">(b)</span> In the case of new vehicles, the full delivered cash price shall include any dealer processing charge and freight charge, unless the dealer clearly and conspicuously discloses the amount of these charges in the advertisement as required by <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gtr&amp;section=15-311" title="">Transportation Article, §15-311</a>.1, Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> A specific price may not be stated in an advertisement as an offer for a trade-in, if the price so stated is contingent upon the condition, model, or age of the prospective buyer vehicles, without so stating in the advertisement. The use of phrases such as “up to” and “as much as” may not be considered as adequate explanation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Repossessions. The term “repossessed” shall be used only to describe those vehicles legally repossessed as a result of failure of an owner to fulfill the conditions of a lien contract. Advertisers offering repossessed vehicles for sale, upon request, shall offer proof of the repossessions. The amount quoted as an unpaid balance shall be the full selling price unless otherwise stated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> Demonstrator Vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H(1)">(1)</span> Demonstrator vehicles are considered used vehicles if they have been driven for more than 7,500 miles.</p>
