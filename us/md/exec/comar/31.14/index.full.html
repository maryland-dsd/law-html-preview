                <p>According to [your application] [information you have furnished], you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing long-term care or health insurance and replace it with an individual long-term care insurance policy to be issued by [company name] Insurance Company. Your new policy provides thirty (30) days within which you may decide, without cost, whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new policy.</p>
                <p>You should review this new coverage carefully, comparing it with all long-term care or health insurance coverage you now have, and terminate your present policy only if, after due consideration, you find that purchase of this long-term care coverage is a wise decision.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY AGENT [BROKER OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE]: (Use additional sheets, as necessary.)</p>
                <p>I have reviewed your current medical or health insurance coverage. I believe the replacement of insurance involved in this transaction materially improves your position. My conclusion has taken into account the following considerations, which I call to your attention:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.01.22#1">1.</span> Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting conditions), may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay in payment of benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.01.22#2">2.</span> The law provides that your replacement policy or certificate may not contain new preexisting conditions or probationary periods. The insurer will waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions or probationary periods in the new policy (or coverage) for similar benefits to the extent of time elapsed under the original policy or certificate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.01.22#3">3.</span> If you are replacing existing long-term care insurance coverage, you may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy. This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest to make sure you understand everything that is involved in replacing your present coverage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.01.22#4">4.</span> If, after you have thought about it, you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer all questions on the application concerning your medical health history. Failure to include all material medical information in an application may provide a basis for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, reread it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded.</p>

                <p>Your recent application for long-term care insurance included a "personal worksheet," which asked questions about your finances and your reasons for buying long-term care insurance. For your protection, State law requires us to consider this information when we review your application, to avoid selling a policy to those who may not need coverage.</p>
                <p>[Your answers indicate that long-term care insurance may not meet your financial needs. We suggest that you review the information provided along with your application, including the booklet "Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance" and the page titled "Things You Should Know Before Buying Long-Term Care Insurance." Your state insurance department also has information about long-term care insurance and may be able to refer you to a counselor free of charge who can help you decide whether to buy this policy.]</p>
                <p>[You chose not to provide any financial information for us to review.]</p>
                <p>Drafting Note: Choose the paragraph that applies.</p>
                <p>We have suspended our final review of your application. If, after careful consideration, you still believe this policy is what you want, check the appropriate box below and return this letter to us within the next 60 days. We will then continue reviewing your application and issue a policy if you meet our medical standards.</p>
                <p>If we do not hear from you within the next 60 days, we will close your file and not issue you a policy. You should understand that you will not have any coverage until we hear back from you, approve your application and issue you a policy.</p>
                <p>Please check one box and return in the enclosed envelope.</p>
                <p>[] Yes, [although my worksheet indicates that long-term care insurance may not be a suitable purchase,] I wish to purchase this coverage. Please resume review of my application.</p>

                </p>
                <p>People buy long-term care insurance for many reasons. Some don't want to use their own assets to pay for long-term care. Some buy insurance to make sure they can choose the type of care they get. Others don't want their family to have to pay for care or don't want to go on Medicaid. But long-term care insurance may be expensive, and may not be right for everyone.</p>
                <p>By state law, the insurance company must fill out part of the information on this worksheet and ask you to fill out the rest to help you and the company decide if you should buy this policy.</p>

[The company has never raised its rates for any long-term care policy it has sold in this state or any other state.] [The company has not raised its rates for this policy form or similar policy forms in this state or any other state in the last 10 years.] [The company has raised its premium rates on this policy form or similar policy forms in the last 10 years.

                <p><strong>Drafting Note:</strong> A company may use the first bracketed sentence above only if it has never increased rates under any prior policy forms in this state or any other state. The issuer shall list each premium increase it has instituted on this or similar policy forms in this state or any other state during the last 10 years. The list shall provide the policy form, the calendar years the form was available for sale, and the calendar year and the amount (percentage) of each increase. The insurer shall provide minimum and maximum percentages if the rate increase is variable by rating characteristics. The insurer may provide, in a fair manner, additional explanatory information as appropriate.</p>

                <p>• Reduce your policy benefits to a level such that your premiums will not increase. (Subject to state law minimum standards.)</p>
                <p>• Exercise your nonforfeiture option if purchased. (This option is available for purchase for an additional premium.)</p>
                <p>• Exercise your contingent nonforfeiture rights.* (This option may be available if you do not purchase a separate nonforfeiture option.)</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>* Contingent Nonforfeiture</strong>
                </p>
                <p>If the premium rate for your policy goes up in the future and you didn't buy a nonforfeiture option, you may be eligible for contingent nonforfeiture. Here's how to tell if you are eligible:</p>
                <p>You will keep some long-term care insurance coverage, if:</p>
                <p>• Your premium after the increase exceeds your original premium by the percentage shown (or more) in the following table; and</p>
                <p>• You lapse (not pay more premiums) within 120 days of the increase.</p>
                <p>The amount of coverage (i.e., new lifetime maximum benefit amount) you will keep will equal the total amount of premiums you've paid since your policy was first issued. If you have already received benefits under the policy, so that the remaining maximum benefit amount is less than the total amount of premiums you've paid, the amount of coverage will be that remaining amount.</p>
                <p>Except for this reduced lifetime maximum benefit amount, all other policy benefits will remain at the levels attained at the time of the lapse and will not increase thereafter.</p>
                <p>Should you choose this Contingent Nonforfeiture option, your policy, with this reduced maximum benefit amount, will be considered "paid-up" with no further premiums due.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Example:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>• You bought the policy at age 65 and paid the $1,000 annual premium for 10 years, so you have paid a total of $10,000 in premium.</p>
                <p>• In the 11th year, you receive a rate increase of 50%, or $500 for a new annual premium of $1,500, and you decide to lapse the policy (not pay any more premiums).</p>
                <p>• Your "paid-up" policy benefits are $10,000 (provided you have at least $10,000 of benefits remaining under your policy.)</p>

                <p>The format and required text of the Partnership Policy Status Disclosure Notice referred to in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/31.14.03.05#C(3)" title="">Regulation .05C(3) of this chapter</a> shall read as follows:</p>
                <p>[Carrier letterhead]</p>
                <p>Important Notice Regarding Your Policy's Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership Policy Status</p>
                <p>(Please keep this Notice with Your Policy or Certificate)</p>
                <p>Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership. The Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership is an innovative partnership between Maryland and private insurers of long-term care insurance policies. The Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership is established in accordance with the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109—171).</p>
                <p>Notice of Partnership Policy Status. Your long-term care insurance {policy} {certificate} is intended to qualify as a Partnership {policy} {certificate} under the {insert state} Long-Term Care Partnership Program as of your {policy's} {certificate's} effective date.</p>
                <p>Medicaid Asset Protection Provided. Long-term care insurance is an important tool that helps individuals prepare for future long-term care needs. Partnership Policies provide an additional level of protection. In particular, such policies permit individuals to protect additional assets from spend-down requirements under a Medicaid program if assistance under this program is ever needed and you otherwise qualify for Medicaid.</p>
                <p>Specifically, the asset eligibility and recovery provisions of the Medicaid program of Maryland are applied by disregarding an additional amount of assets which is equal to the amount of long-term care insurance benefits you have received from your Partnership Policy. For example, if you receive $200,000 of insurance benefits from your Partnership Policy, you generally would be able to retain $200,000 of assets above and beyond the amount of assets normally permitted for Medicaid eligibility.</p>
                <p>Other Medicaid eligibility requirements apart from permissible assets must be met, including special rules that may apply if the equity in your home exceeds $500,000. This equity value limit may change over time based on Federal standards. In addition, you must meet the Medicaid program's income requirements and may be required to contribute some of your income to the costs of your care once you become eligible for Medicaid.</p>
                <p>Additional Consumer Protections. In addition to providing Medicaid asset protection, your Partnership Policy has other important features. Under the rules governing the Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership, your Partnership Policy must be a qualified long-term care insurance contract under Federal tax law, and as such the insurance benefits you receive from the policy generally will be subject to beneficial income tax treatment. (Please note that a policy can be a qualified long-term care insurance contract under Federal tax law, with the same beneficial income tax treatment, even if it is not a Partnership Policy.) In addition, if you were under age 76 when you purchased your Partnership Policy, it must provide inflation protection to help protect against potential future increases in the cost of long-term care. (For older purchasers, an offer of inflation protection is required.)</p>
                <p>What Could Disqualify Your Policy as a Partnership Policy. If you make any changes to your Partnership Policy or certificate, such changes could affect whether your policy or certificate continues to qualify as a Partnership Policy. Before you make any changes, you should consult with the issuer of your Partnership Policy to determine the effect of a proposed change. In addition, if you move to a state that does not maintain a Qualified Partnership or does not recognize your policy as a Partnership Policy, you would not receive Medicaid asset protection in that state. Also, changes in Federal or State law could affect the Medicaid asset protection available with respect to your Partnership Policy.</p>
