                <p>The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe standards, policies, and procedures for the collection of claims of the State and the preparation, submission, and processing of information on delinquent accounts subject to transfer by State agencies to the Central Collection Unit (CCU).</p>

                <p>This chapter applies to the collection of all claims, delinquent accounts, and debts owed to the State or to an agency or official of the State in his official capacity, except those exempt by law from referral to the Central Collection Unit. The nature of certain claims owed to the State may cause the strict application of one or more of these standards to be impractical or not in the best interest of the State. Agencies may deviate from these standards only if this deviation has been requested in writing from and approved by the Secretary of Budget and Management. The written request shall specify the precise nature of the deviation or deviations, the types of account or accounts or claim or claims to be governed by the deviation or deviations, and the justification for these deviated standards.</p>

Whenever the debtor may be eligible for benefits or financial assistance from a third party, such as veteran benefits, Medicaid, or Medicare, to help satisfy the debtor's obligation to the State, the agency shall render any assistance that it may deem reasonable and proper to assist the debtor in making claim on the third party, including billing the third party on behalf of the debtor. Collections from these third parties shall be used to reduce the debtor's obligation to the State to the extent permitted by law. In determining account delinquency, a debtor's refusal to apply for or make a claim for benefits from a third-party payor shall have the same effect as a refusal of benefits to the debtor by the third-party payor.</p>

Claims should be collected in full in one lump sum whenever this is possible. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. The size and frequency of these installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. If liquidation by installment payments should require more than 3 years, then the claim should be transferred as a delinquent account to CCU. An agency holding an unsecured claim for administrative collection may attempt to obtain an executed confessed judgement note. The form and content of these notes shall be as prescribed by the legal counsel of the agency concerned. Security for deferred payments, other than a confessed judgement note, may be accepted in appropriate cases. An agency may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of a debtor to execute a confessed judgement note or to give other security, at the agency's option.</p>
