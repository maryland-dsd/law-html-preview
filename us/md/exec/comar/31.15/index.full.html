                <p>The following shall govern the contents of advertisements and public announcements concerning financial condition of insurers:</p>

Except as provided elsewhere in this chapter, or as may be permitted by order of the Commissioner, every advertisement, sign, pamphlet, circular, card, or other public announcement, issued or distributed in this State by any domestic or foreign insurer, a subsidiary thereof, a holding company or controlled person as defined in <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gin&amp;section=7-101" title="">Insurance Article, §7-101, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, or by any agent of any of the foregoing, purporting to make known the separate financial condition of the insurer, shall show the amount of its admitted assets, its liabilities and reserves required or permitted by law, and the amount of its surplus as regards policyholders, and the same may not materially conflict with the true annual statement filed by it with the Commissioner next preceding the publication of the advertisement or the public distribution of the announcement. The surplus as regards policyholders shall show therein the amount of the paid up capital stock, if any, of the insurer. The foregoing does not apply to an advertisement, sign, pamphlet, circular, card, or other public announcement concerning an insurer showing only the amount of its capital paid up, or the surplus of the insurer and its capital, if any, separately or combined, but these items may not be in excess of the corresponding item shown on the true annual statement filed by the insurer with the Commissioner next preceding the making or issuing of the advertisement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/exec/comar/31.15.05.03#B">B.</span> Alien Insurers.

The surplus as regards policyholders shall show therein the amount of the statutory deposits of the United States branch, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement, any authorized life insurance company or fraternal society organized under the laws of Canada or any province of Canada may use in its advertising in this State a statement of its complete financial condition, in addition to its statement showing the amount of its total admitted assets and liabilities in the United States if a similar domestic insurer is permitted by the laws of Canada or any province of Canada to advertise therein its complete financial condition on a corresponding basis.</p>
