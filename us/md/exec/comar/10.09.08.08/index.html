                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Providers shall be divided into those located in urban areas and those located in rural areas. Baltimore City and the Maryland counties of Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Charles, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George's, St. Mary’s and Wicomico are urban areas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> All other Maryland counties are rural areas.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Following the close of the provider's 2nd fiscal year, the Department or its designee shall determine the final all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate for primary care services and, if offered, for dental care services, for those fiscal years based on the costs stated in the cost report for the 2 fiscal years and subject to the limitations in these regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> The provider shall submit to the Department or the Department's designee, on the form prescribed, direct and indirect costs and statistical data applicable to patient care.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(4)">(4)</span> In calculating the final all-inclusive cost-per-visit rates, the limitation on general service cost center costs described in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.08.08#D(5)(a)" title="">§D(5)(a) of this regulation</a> shall apply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(5)">(5)</span> Once the all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate has been determined for each fiscal year, each provider is eligible for additional primary care reimbursement for services rendered by OB/GYN physicians, staff who provide radiology services, off-site visits, and out-stationed eligibility workers. Costs for these additional services are limited to salaries and fringe benefits, including any malpractice insurance, that are paid by the provider. The additional primary care reimbursement shall be calculated by taking the sum of the provider's expenditures for OB/GYN physicians, for staff who provide radiology services, out-stationed eligibility workers, and off-site visits. This sum is divided by the total number of primary care visits. The resulting rate shall be added to the all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(6)">(6)</span> The final all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate shall be determined by averaging the all-inclusive cost-per-visit rates for the 2 fiscal years and by adding, if applicable, the additional rate for OB/GYN, staff who provide radiology services, or off-site visits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(7)">(7)</span> This final all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate shall be implemented retroactively to the start date of the FQHC’s operation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(8)">(8)</span> The final all-inclusive rate shall be increased by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) each calendar year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(9)">(9)</span> The provider shall maintain adequate financial records and statistical data according to generally accepted accounting principles and procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(10)">(10)</span> The provider shall keep all records available for a period of 6 years subject to inspection or audit by the Department or the Department's designee at any reasonable time during normal business hours.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> A provider shall submit to the Department or the Department's designee a cost report, and other financial and statistical information requested, within 3 months after the close of the provider's 2nd fiscal year, unless the Department grants the provider an extension or the provider discontinues participation as a federally qualified health center. The following apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)(a)">(a)</span> The Program may grant a provider an extension if the provider makes a written request setting forth the specific reasons for the request and the Department determines that the request is reasonable; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> Cost reports are considered to have been received by the Department or the Department's designee when the submitted reports are completed according to the instructions issued by the Department, or the Department's designee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> If a provider's cost report has not been received within 3 months after the close of the provider's 2nd fiscal year or within the deadline set by the Department after an extension has been granted, the Department shall reduce the provider's current interim all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate by 20 percent for visits paid during the calendar month in which the report is due and any subsequent calendar month until the report has been submitted. This amount shall be eligible for repayment to the provider upon final cost settlement for the fiscal year or fiscal years from which the payments were withheld.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> When a provider's cost report is received by the last day of the 6th month after the end of the provider's 2nd fiscal year and the Department or the Department's designee determines that the final all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate is different than the interim all-inclusive cost-per-visit rate, the increase or decrease is applicable to all reimbursable visits retroactively.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(5)">(5)</span> The Department or its designee shall notify each provider of the results of the verification of the provider's cost report.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(6)">(6)</span> The provider may appeal the final cost settlement by following the procedures described in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/exec/comar/10.09.36.09" title=".09 Filing Appeal.">COMAR 10.09.36.09</a>.</p>
