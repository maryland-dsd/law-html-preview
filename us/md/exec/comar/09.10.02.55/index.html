                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A">A.</span> The Pick Six is a form of pari-mutuel wagering. Each bettor selects the first horse in each of six consecutive races designated as the Pick Six races by the Association. The principle of a Pick Six is, in effect, a contract by the purchaser of a Pick Six ticket to select the winners of each of the six races designated as the Pick Six.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B">B.</span> The Pick Six pool shall be held entirely separate from all other pools and is not part of a daily double, exacta, trifecta, or other wagering pool. The Pick Six pool is a pool in which the bettor is required to select six consecutive winning horses and is not a parlay.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C">C.</span> Repealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D">D.</span> Races in which Pick Six pools shall be conducted shall be approved by the Maryland Racing Commission and clearly designated in the program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E">E.</span> The design of Pick Six tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguished from other pari-mutuel tickets with the identification "Pick 6" printed on the ticket.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F">F.</span> The Pick Six pari-mutuel pool shall be calculated as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(1)">(1)</span> Seventy-five percent of the net amount in the pari-mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed among the holders of pari-mutuel tickets which correctly designate the official winner in each of the six races comprising the Pick Six. The remaining undistributed 25 percent of the net pool shall be distributed among the holders of pari-mutuel tickets which correctly designate the most winning selections less than the six winning selections described above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(2)">(2)</span> If there is no pari-mutuel ticket held which correctly designates the winner of all races comprising the Pick Six, 75 percent of that racing date's net amount available for distribution shall be carried over and included in the Pick Six pool requiring six winning selections, at the next performance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(3)">(3)</span> If a Pick Six ticket designates as a selection to win in any one or more of the contests comprising the Pick Six, a single wagering interest which is scratched, excused or determined by the stewards to be a non-starter in the race, the actual favorite, as evidenced by the amounts wagered in the win pool at the time of the start, will be substituted for the non-starting selection for all purposes including pool calculations and payoffs, provided further that if the win pool for two or more favorites is identical, the selection shall be the lowest program number substituted for the non-starting selection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(4)">(4)</span> The cancellation of one or more contests comprising the Pick Six in any performance shall result in that day's net pool being fully distributed to the individuals holding the most winners on that day's performance. If three or more of the six contests comprising the Pick Six are officially cancelled or declared as no contest, all pari- mutuel tickets on the Pick Six for that performance shall be refunded, and the Pick Six shall be cancelled for that performance. Any contributions to the Pick Six pool from prior performances will remain in the Pick Six pool to be carried over and included in the Pick Six pool for the next performance as prescribed in §F(2), above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F(5)">(5)</span> If the accumulated Pick Six has not been distributed prior to the closing day of the meeting in which the Pick Six pool was generated, the accumulated Pick Six pool and the net amount in the Best of Six pool, subject to distribution among winning ticket holders, shall be distributed among closing day holders of Pick Six tickets which correctly designate the most official winners of the six contests comprising the closing day Pick Six. Should there be a cancellation of the final day's card, or if the final day of Pick Six pool is cancelled, the contributions shall be transferred to the next harness track to operate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G">G.</span> Those horses constituting an entry or a field as defined within the regulations of the Maryland Racing Commission shall race in any Pick Six race as a single wagering interest for the purpose of the Pick Six race pari-mutuel pool calculations and payouts to the public. A scratch, after wagering has begun, of any part of any entry or field selection in such a race shall be of no effect with respect to the status of this entry or field, or both, as a viable wagering interest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H">H.</span> If, for any reason, any race or races of a Pick Six program is cancelled and declared "No Race", the Pick Six pool shall be distributed to the holders of the most winning selections of the remaining races pursuant to §F. If the judges cancel or declare "No Race" in three or more of the Pick Six races for any given date, all pari-mutuel tickets for that Pick Six pool shall be refunded and the Pick Six cancelled for that day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I">I.</span> If there is a dead-heat for win between two or more horses in any Pick Six race, all these horses in the dead-heat for win shall be considered as the winning horse in the race for the purpose of distributing the Pick Six pari-mutuel pool.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J">J.</span> A person may not disclose the number of tickets sold in the Pick Six pool or the number or amount of tickets selecting winners of Pick Six races before the time the judges have declared the last Pick Six race on any given date "official".</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K">K.</span> A pari-mutuel ticket for the Pick Six pool may not be sold, exchanged, or cancelled after the time of the closing of wagering in the first of the six races comprising the Pick Six.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L">L.</span> A validly issued Pick Six ticket timely surrendered to the association by the legal holder of it shall be the only evidence of a person's participation in the Pick Six pari-mutuel pool. The acceptance of a Pick Six ticket by taking an issued ticket away from the window or terminal from which it is purchased shall constitute an acknowledgement by the purchaser of the correctness of the ticket, and each purchaser of a Pick Six ticket agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of this and all other applicable Commission rules and regulations and by the laws of the State pertaining to pari-mutuel wagering. The association, totalisator company, and the State may not be liable to a person for a ticket which is not a winning ticket in accordance with the provisions of this rule. The association, totalisator company, and the State may not be liable to a person for a Pick Six ticket not delivered for any reason, including but not limited to mechanical malfunction, electrical failure, machine locking, or other cause.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M">M.</span> This rule shall be prominently displayed throughout the betting area of each association conducting a Pick Six program.</p>
