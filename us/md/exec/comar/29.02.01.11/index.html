The law requires the owner to have, in the vehicle at the time the vehicle is stopped by a police officer, a written certification that details the owner’s medical need for tinted windows, from a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State. A vehicle owner whose vehicle is undergoing an inspection, or has been issued a safety equipment repair order for defect #61 “TINT”, and indicates to the authorized inspection station their compliance with a medical exemption, shall be referred to the Automotive Safety Enforcement Division of the Department of State Police for examination of the vehicle owner’s medical documentation and the vehicle’s post-manufacture window tint. If the owner meets the requirements specified in <a class="internal-link " href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/laws/StatuteText?article=gtr&amp;section=22-406" title="">Transportation Article, §22-406, Annotated Code of Maryland</a>, for the medical exemption and the vehicle is compliant with all post-manufacture window tinting regulations in this chapter, excluding the light transmittance requirement of regulated windows equipped with post-manufacture window tint, the Division shall be authorized to certify the safety equipment repair order for defect #61 “TINT”. A medical exemption is not applicable to vehicles listed in §F(4) and (5) of this regulation.</p>
