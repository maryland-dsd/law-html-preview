                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(5)">(5)</span> Inducing trading in a client's account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources, objectives, and character of the account.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(9)">(9)</span> Providing a report or recommendation to an advisory client prepared by a person other than the investment adviser without disclosing that fact, except that this prohibition does not apply to a situation in which the investment adviser uses published research reports or statistical analyses to render advice or a situation in which an adviser orders these reports in the normal course of providing services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B(10)">(10)</span> Charging a client an unreasonable advisory fee in light of the fees charged by other investment advisers providing essentially the same services.</p>
