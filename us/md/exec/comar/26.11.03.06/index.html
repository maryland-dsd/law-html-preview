                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)">(1)</span> Duty to Comply. The permit shall contain a provision requiring the permittee to comply with all terms and conditions of the Part 70 permit and providing that noncompliance with the federally enforceable conditions constitutes a violation of the Clean Air Act and is subject to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)(a)">(a)</span> Enforcement action;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)(b)">(b)</span> Permit revocation or revision;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)(c)">(c)</span> Denial of an application for renewal of the permit; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E(1)(d)">(d)</span> Any combination of these actions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(2)">(2)</span> Need to Halt or Reduce Activity Not a Defense. The permit shall contain a provision that it is not a defense in an enforcement action for the permittee to establish that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce activity related to the permitted source in order to comply with the conditions of the permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(3)">(3)</span> Permit Actions. The permit shall contain a provision that the permit may be revoked or reopened and revised for cause. The filing of an application by the permittee for a permit revision or renewal, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes to a permitted source or anticipated noncompliance does not stay a term or condition of a Part 70 permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(4)">(4)</span> Property Rights. The permit shall contain a provision that the permit does not convey any property rights or any exclusive privilege.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E(5)">(5)</span> Duty to Provide Information. The permit shall contain a provision that the permittee shall furnish to the Department, within a reasonable time specified by the Department, information that the Department may request in writing to determine whether the permittee is in compliance with the federally enforceable provisions of the permit or whether cause exists for revising or revoking the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the Department records required to be kept under the permit. For information claimed by the permittee to be confidential and therefore potentially not disclosable to the public, the Department may require the permittee to provide a copy of the records directly to the EPA along with the claim of confidentiality.</p>
