                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(1)">(1)</span> For nonenterable underground tanks, conduct at least annually a leak test that meets the requirements of Regulation .10-2B(3)(e)(i) of this chapter, or other tank integrity method as approved or required by the Secretary;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(2)">(2)</span> For other than nonenterable underground tanks, either conduct a leak test as in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/exec/comar/26.13.05.10-4#G(1)" title="">§G(1) of this regulation</a>, or develop a schedule and procedure for an assessment of the overall condition of the tank system by an independent, qualified, registered professional engineer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)">(3)</span> Ensure that assessments of the overall condition of the tank system performed instead of a leak test satisfy the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(a)">(a)</span> The schedule and procedure for the assessment is adequate to detect obvious cracks, leaks, and corrosion or erosion that may lead to cracks and leaks;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(b)">(b)</span> Stored waste is removed from the tank, if necessary, to allow the condition of all internal tank surfaces to be assessed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G(3)(c)">(c)</span> The frequency of the assessment is based on the material of construction of the tank and its ancillary equipment, the age of the system, the type of corrosion or erosion protection used, the rate of corrosion or erosion observed during the previous inspection, and the characteristics of the waste being stored or treated;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(4)">(4)</span> For ancillary equipment, conduct at least annually a leak test or other integrity assessment as approved by the Secretary;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(5)">(5)</span> Maintain on file at the facility a record of the results of the assessments conducted in accordance with §G(1)-(4) of this regulation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G(6)">(6)</span> Comply with the requirements of Regulation .10-6 of this chapter if a tank system or component is found to be leaking or unfit for use as a result of the leak test or assessment performed in accordance with §G(1)-(4) of this regulation.</p>
