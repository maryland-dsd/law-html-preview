(c) Institutional supervision by the aftercare counselor of the Department of Juvenile Services consists of at least monthly face-to-face contact with each child, monthly contact with parents/family and attendance at the child's periodic case reviews. It is designed to: (i) Build a relationship with the child and family; (ii) Evaluate status of the parents' ability to reintegrate the child into the family when released and provide services aimed at achieving reintegration; (iii) Develop an alternative living situation if the child is not able to return home either temporarily or permanently; and (iv) Provide information to the institutional juvenile counselor relative to the child's family and community.

{"body": "Code of Maryland Regulations .06 Guidelines for Youth Diversion Programs Receiving State Funds. A. Nature of Services Delivered. (1) Youth diversion programs shall provide services in a manner which is appealing and accessible to their community. This requires flexible hours and may entail the use of an outreach approach or satellite centers, or both. (2) Youth diversion programs are responsible for developing and maintaining community rapport. (3) Programs may not systematically deny service to any groups of youths in their communities. (4) Programs may not be required to provide services to youth who, in the best judgment of the program staff, are in need of services beyond those which the program is capable of offering. In this case, the programs shall attempt to refer the participant to an appropriate agency for service. (5) Diversion programs shall maintain a listing of community services to which participants may be referred. The listing shall include at least the name of the referral service, its address, telephone number, and eligibility requirements. (6) Youth diversion programs shall make use of existing public and private services in their communities by referral and networking with those services which are available and appropriate. Programs shall provide the participant with whatever assistance is needed to follow through with the referral. In addition, it is the program's responsibility to follow up on each formal case referred to determine whether the service was provided by the agency to which the referral was made. (7) Youth diversion programs shall provide written or verbal feedback to the worker making the referral to the program regarding the acceptance of referrals. The worker shall be periodically informed of the individual's participation in the diversion program. B. Internal Management and Operation. (1) Internal management, evaluation of staff, and other aspects of the daily operations of the diversion programs are the responsibility of the program director. (2) Youth diversion programs shall be staffed by professionals or paraprofessionals, or both. The use of volunteers to expand services and support the paid staff is recommended. (3) Youth diversion programs shall maintain case record files on each formal counseling case when the youth is seen on a regular basis. Program shall maintain physical custody of case records at all times. (4) The diversion program staff shall provide suitable protection for case record files. Information in these files is confidential. Accordingly, client-identifying data from case files will be released to individuals or agencies outside the program staff only if the participant has given his or her permission in writing, and then only when considered appropriate by the program. (5) The agency operating the youth diversion program shall have an advisory board or board of directors, or both, which is representative of youth and adult community members, agency staff, and professionals in the human services field. (6) The Department of Juvenile Services shall define the specific geographical areas which the program will serve, and the programs shall make their catchment areas known to all agencies or organizations from which the program may receive referrals. Catchment areas may not be so large as to prohibit proper coverage or so small as to ignore natural boundaries. Diversion programs shall make sure, at all times, that they are adequately serving the needs of youth in their designated catchment areas before extending their services to youth outside these areas. (7) Diversion programs shall serve, on a priority basis, those youth and their families referred by the Department of Juvenile Services or the State's Attorney's Office, or both, for the juvenile court or as specified, according to individual contracts.", "num": ".06", "path": "library|Code of Maryland Regulations|16|17|02|.06", "title": ".06 Guidelines for Youth Diversion Programs Receiving State Funds.", "url": "/us/md/exec/comar/16.17.02.06"}

{"body": "Code of Maryland Regulations .07 Program Accountability. A. Monitoring. (1) The basic task involved in monitoring is to determine whether the program is providing services in compliance with the contract. The primary data collected shall be the: (a) Number of clients served annually; (b) Age, sex, race, address, offense or activity which led to referral, and prior offense history, if any, for each client served; and (c) Services which are provided to each client. (2) The tools used to monitor diversion programs are: (a) The quarterly reporting form; (b) On-site visits conducted at least once during the contract year; (c) Case reviews. (3) Irregularities indicated in the quarterly report shall be brought to the attention of the program. Additional information may be required. B. Evaluation. (1) The basic evaluative tool to be used for determining effectiveness is the comprehensive follow-up. Data on the adjudication status of a diversion program's formal caseload will be reported at the quarter of termination, and 1 and 2 years after termination. (2) The extent of adjudication among the youth intensively served will be verified by examining, when possible, records retained by the Department of Juvenile Services. Records and reports from other agencies and self-reported information from youth served may be accepted also. (3) The method used to obtain adjudication information will be identified in the evaluative report. This evaluation shall show the effect of a program on the delinquent behavior of its participants (as measured by whether they are adjudicated). Individual diversion programs may use their own staff or field work students and volunteers to produce evaluations of a more sophisticated nature.

{"body": "Code of Maryland Regulations .14 Criteria for Certification of Qualified Maryland Biotechnology Companies. A. The Department shall assess the merits of a company\u2019s application for certification as a qualified Maryland Biotechnology company according to: (1) The criteria set forth in this chapter; (2) The definition of biotechnology stated in \u00a7C of this regulation ; and (3) Other metrics and measures that the Secretary may adopt for uniform application under this chapter. B. The Department shall apply a facts and circumstances analysis on a case by case basis to determine whether a company meets the criteria of this chapter. C. Biotechnology. (1) Definition. (a) \u201cBiotechnology\u201d means innovative and proprietary technology that comprises, interacts with, or analyzes biological material including biomolecules (DNA, RNA, or protein), cells, tissues, or organs and includes the application of scientific and technical advances to develop commercial products. (b) \u201cBiotechnology\u201d includes the following: (i) DNA/RNA: Genomics, pharmacogenomics, gene probes, genetic engineering, DNA/RNA sequencing/synthesis/amplification, gene expression profiling, and use of antisense technology; (ii) Proteins and other biomolecules including sugars, lipids, vitamins and metabolics; sequencing, synthesis, or engineering of molecules; improved delivery methods for drugs; isolation; purification, and identification of cell receptors; (iii) Cell and tissue culture and engineering: Cell/tissue culture, tissue engineering (including tissue scaffolds and biomedical engineering), cellular fusion, vaccine/immune stimulants, embryo manipulation; (iv) Process biotechnology techniques: fermentation using bioreactors, bioprocessing, bioleaching, biopulping, biobleaching, biodesulphurisation, bioremediation, biofiltration, and phytoremediation; (v) Gene and RNA vectors: gene therapy, viral vectors; (vi) Bioinformatics: construction of databases on genomes, protein sequences; modeling complex biological processes, including systems biology and mechanism of actions of drugs; and (vii) Nanobiotechnology: Applies the tools and processes of nano/microfabrication to build devices for studying biosystems and applications in drug delivery, diagnostics, and other applications. (2) Single Definition. (a) Section C(1)(a) of this regulation is referred to in this chapter as \u201cthe single definition\u201d. The single definition is deliberately broad, general, and provisional. The single definition applies to the word \u201cbiotechnology\u201d as used in the term \u201cbiotechnology company\u201d stated in Tax-General Article, \u00a710-725(a)(2), Annotated Code of Maryland . (b) The single definition connotes the manipulation of living organisms or their components to produce useful commercial products and the innovative and proprietary technologies of biological science used in this manipulation. (3) List\u2013Based Definition. The list-based definition is based on the list of biotechnology techniques in \u00a7C(1)(b) of this regulation and will function for the Department as an interpretative guideline to the single definition. The list is indicative rather than exhaustive and is expected to change over time as biotechnology techniques evolve. (4) The single definition covers all modern biotechnology but also many traditional or borderline activities. In application by the Department under this chapter, the single definition will always be accompanied by the list-based definition stated in \u00a7C(1)(b) of this regulation when the Department applies the single definition to particular facts and circumstances for the purposes of this chapter. The single definition and the list definition will be applied in conjunction under this chapter to take account of and to consider biotechnology techniques that fit the single definition but may not fit the list\u2013based definition, with a view to constantly updating the list-based definition. D. Criteria for a Biotechnology Company. (1) A biotechnology company is a company primarily dedicated to turning the biological sciences into a commercial product and to commercialize the results. The Department shall apply the single definition and the list definition to determine whether a company\u2019s activities or products constitute biotechnology for the purposes of the Act and this chapter. (2) The scientific biotechnological basis of the company\u2019s activities and plans is defining, but not conclusive. (3) The company shall demonstrate that the investment it will attract by reason of the tax credit available under the Act and this chapter will be likely to: (a) Materially advance and support the business viability of the company; and (b) Result in the production of a biotechnology product that will contribute to economic development and employment growth in the State. (4) Stage of Development. The company shall: (a) Have begun active activities and operations and fairly be characterized as actively engaged in a biotechnology business; (b) Be fully legally organized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was organized; (c) Have competent management; (d) Own or have immediately available and useable rights in biotechnology-related intellectual property; and (e) Be actively engaged in research, development, or production of a commercially oriented, innovative, and patent protectable biotechnology product. (5) Eligibility: \u201cActive Business\u201d. (a) Except as provided in \u00a7C(5)(b) of this regulation, a company is eligible for certification as a qualified Maryland biotechnology company if it has been in active business not longer than 10 years. (b) A company that has been in active business for up to 12 years may be eligible for certification as a QMBC if the Department determines that the company requires additional time to complete the process of regulatory approval of a biotechnology product. (c) \u201cActive business\u201d means that the Department can reasonably determine and establish the nature of the Company\u2019s commercial biotechnology research, development or production operations. The mere legal organization, appointment or election of officers or managers, initial capitalization, and establishment of business offices of a company, alone or in combination, are not sufficient to establish that the company is engaged in active business for the purposes of this chapter and the Act. (d) The Department shall apply a facts and circumstances analysis on a case by case basis to determine whether a company has been engaged in active business and for what period of time. (6) Commercialization of an Identifiable Biotechnology Product. (a) The company shall have a developed, focused plan for: (i) Research and development of an identifiable biotechnology product; and (ii) The company\u2019s growth. (b) A biotechnology product will generally be: (i) Used for human health, as in a therapeutic or diagnostic setting (for example, to treat, detect, or prevent diseases or to improve treatment outcomes); (ii) Used on domesticated or farm animals, as in a therapeutic or diagnostic setting (for example, to improve animal health); or plants (for example to increase agricultural production); or (iii) An application originally derived from use of a living organism, as in production of alternative energy (e.g., biofuels) or engineering or chemistry derived from nature to improve properties of products (for example, re-engineering of attachment molecules used by mollusks for the next SuperGlue\u00ae). (c) In general, companies will not be certified that provide a service (e.g., analytical services or consulting services, etc.) or develop software, or develop or manufacture products or technology that do not involve use or application of biotechnology. (d) A device may constitute eligible biotechnology if: (i) It delivers a direct therapeutic effect through biological interaction; or (ii) It performs a diagnosis through analyzing biological material. (7) Innovative Biotechnology Projects and Products. The company shall provide evidence with its application that its existing or proposed biotechnology product is innovative and has the potential for commercial sale. The company must generally own the intellectual property or have exclusive rights to the use of the intellectual property. (8) Maryland Location. (a) The company shall demonstrate that its headquarters and the base of its biotechnology operations are entirely located in the State. (b) The company shall provide with its application evidence that it will maintain its headquarters, the base of its biotechnology operations, and the sites, buildings, and facilities in which its headquarters and biotechnology operations are or will be conducted, in the State for a period of not less than 48 months after the date on which its application for certification as a qualified Maryland biotechnology company is submitted to the Department.", "num": ".14", "path": "library|Code of Maryland Regulations|24|05|03|.14", "title": ".14 Criteria for Certification of Qualified Maryland Biotechnology Companies.", "url": "/us/md/exec/comar/24.05.03.14"}

All State agencies are encouraged to initiate and conduct on a continuing basis a survey of all real property under their control and jurisdiction to identify those properties which are not utilized, are under-utilized, or are not being put to optimum use and are not required to meet future needs. These regulations are intended to provide guidance to State agencies for the reporting of excess and substantial changes in State- owned real property and requests for the granting of rights-of-way or easements and to establish the coordination procedures associated with the reports submitted. This program will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the acquisition of real property when State agency needs can be met by utilizing real property currently owned by the State, and insure that maximum benefits to the State are realized by the utilization or disposal of this property for the most appropriate use which is compatible with the plans and programs of State and local agencies. Further, it will reduce the necessity for the expenditure of State funds for the operation, care, and maintenance of property not needed to meet current or projected requirements.", "num": ".02", "path": "library|Code of Maryland Regulations|34|02|02|.02", "title": ".02 Purpose.", "url": "/us/md/exec/comar/34.02.02.02"}

The Trust shall make a determination of the age of the property or its eligibility for the National Register within 14 days of receipt of the report and notify the person submitting the report of the Trust's determination. If, in the opinion of the Trust, the report provides insufficient information to determine the age of the property or its eligibility for the National Register, the Trust may request that an intensive survey be conducted. Accordingly, submerged archeological historic property that is embedded in submerged lands is considered as having remained unclaimed for 100 years or longer until proven otherwise through: (a) An intensive survey conducted in accordance with these regulations; or (b) A determination by the Trust made either upon the Trust's initiation or upon filing of a report of finding in accordance with this subsection. (5) These regulations do not: (a) Limit or prohibit the use of privately owned land by the owner of the land, or require the owner to obtain a permit from the Trust for any activity on the privately owned land; or (b) Abrogate or supplant any power of the State Highway Administration. B. Property of State\u2014Exceptions. (1) Except as provided in \u00a7B(2) of this regulation , all submerged archeological historic property is the property of the State in accordance with the Act.

{"body": "Code of Maryland Regulations .12 Disposition of Artifacts\u2014Conveyance of Title. A. General. The Trust may determine that with respect to a particular application for a data recovery permit under Regulation .10 of this chapter , it is in the best interest of the State to do any of the following, or a combination of any of the following: (1) Retain the State's title and control of recovered submerged archeological historic property; (2) Enter into a disposition agreement and convey the State's title to recovered submerged archeological historic property; or (3) Release the State's title to any recovered submerged archeological historic property that the Trust does not consider to be of significant archeological or historical value. B. Disposition. (1) If the Trust determines that it is in the best interest of the State to enter into a disposition agreement with the permittee, the decision as to what portion of recovered submerged archeological historic property the State will retain shall be based upon the Trust's assessment of the historic and archeological significance of the property following the intensive survey. (2) General Guidelines. (a) Except as provided in \u00a7B(3) of this regulation , the following ranges for the division of recovered artifacts apply: (i) For sites over 100 years old but not included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register, the Trust shall retain the State's title to at least 5 percent but not more than 30 percent of the artifacts in accordance with a final valuation determined through \u00a7C(5) and (6) of this regulation; and (ii) For sites that are included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register, regardless of age, the Trust shall retain the State's title to at least 20 percent but not more than 50 percent of the artifacts in accordance with a final valuation based upon the archeological and monetary market valuations determined through \u00a7C(5) and (6) of this regulation. (b) The Trust shall determine the specific percentage within the ranges referred to in \u00a7B(2)(a) of this regulation by assessing the archeological value of the artifacts in relationship to the whole site. The Trust shall focus this assessment on whether the site contains any or all of the following: (i) Cargo and, if so, whether it is of a repetitive nature or nonrepetitive nature; (ii) Items that were personal possessions of an individual; and (iii) Other artifacts that do not constitute cargo or personal possessions and, if so, whether they are unique or are repetitive as to the site. (c) The Trust may make subsequent modifications to a determined percentage if it is later found that an evaluation of the site was incorrect due to reasons including misdating or misidentification, or the occurrence of unexpected cargo, personal possessions, or other artifacts. (3) Sites Designated or Eligible to be Designated as National Historic Landmarks. (a) For sites that have been designated or are eligible to be designated as National Historic Landmarks, there is a general presumption that the State's title to the artifacts will not be transferred to the permittee. (b) In exceptional circumstances the Trust may consider transfer to the permittee of the State's title to artifacts from sites described in \u00a7B(3)(a) of this regulation if the Director has made, and the Secretary has approved, a written determination that the transfer will not significantly diminish the scientific, archeological, anthropological, or historical research value of the collection. (c) In accordance with the same procedures and requirements described in Regulation .09E(3)\u2014(8) of this chapter, the Trust may make up to 100 percent of the artifacts from sites described in \u00a7B(3)(a) of this regulation available through custodianship for display or exhibition. In addition, the Trust may consider requests that a limited number of the custodial artifacts may be placed into private collections of individuals who were related to the permit activities. C. Title Conveyance Requirements. (1) If the Trust determines that it is in the best interest of the State to enter into a disposition agreement with the permittee, the agreement shall be included within the data recovery permit. The agreement shall document that the: (a) Trust and the applicant have agreed upon a division of the artifacts expected to be recovered which may be in value, in kind, or a combination of both; and (b) Applicant has agreed that the applicant's share of the division constitutes reasonable compensation for the artifacts recovered to which the Trust determines to retain the State's title. (2) The disposition agreement shall be approved by the Board as required by State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a75A-340, Annotated Code of Maryland . (3) The Trust shall act as arbiter of the division of artifacts, giving due consideration to the fair treatment of the applicant and acting in the best interest of the State. In addition, the requirements of \u00a7C(4)\u2014(6) of this regulation apply. (4) The division of artifacts shall be determined in the disposition agreement based upon the valuations set in accordance with \u00a7C(5) and (6) of this regulation. If it is a division in kind, the division applies to each classification of artifacts as specified in the data recovery permit. (5) An archeological valuation of the artifacts shall be determined according to an average valuation by a group of three archaeologists, including the field archeologist, the State Underwater Archeologist or designee, and a third archeologist mutually agreed upon by the Trust and the permittee. This valuation shall take into account the factors referred to in \u00a7B(2)(a)\u2014(c) of this regulation and any other factors considered pertinent by the archaeologists. (6) A monetary market valuation of the artifacts shall be determined according to an average valuation by three independent appraisers, one of which shall be selected by the Trust, one by the permittee, and one mutually agreed upon by the Trust and the permittee. The permittee's costs of artifact recovery and conservation may not be considered in determining the valuation of recovered artifacts. (7) The Trust may grant rights of custodianship to all or a portion of artifacts to which the Trust has retained the State's title in the same manner, and in accordance with the same procedures and requirements, described in Regulation .09E(3)\u2014(8) of this chapter. (8) The terms of a disposition agreement shall include a provision that, except as provided in \u00a7C(9) of this regulation , following the actual disposition of the artifacts, the permittee owns the artifacts free and clear of any interest of the Trust or the State. (9) The terms of a disposition agreement may include: (a) An option or right of first refusal by the Trust to acquire from the permittee after disposition of title one or more artifacts about which the Trust has made a written determination approved by the Secretary to be of exceptional scientific, archeological, anthropological, historical, recreational, or other public value to warrant reacquisition by the Trust in certain circumstances; and (b) The terms of additional compensation to be received by the permittee if, after recovery of the artifacts, the Trust elects to retain title to more artifacts than originally provided for in the disposition agreement. D. Inspection After Recovery. A representative of the Trust and the permittee shall inspect all artifacts recovered under the permit within a reasonable period of time following recovery, but not later than 60 days after the expiration of the permit. E. Actual Disposition. The Trust and the permittee shall carry out the terms of disposition of artifacts as agreed upon in the permit which shall allow for a reasonable period of time for photography, study, research, and conservation of the artifacts before final disposition.
